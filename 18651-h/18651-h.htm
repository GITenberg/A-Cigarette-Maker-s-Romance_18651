<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>
</div>

<p>The inner room of a tobacconist's shop is not perhaps the spot which a
writer of fiction would naturally choose as the theatre of his play, nor
does the inventor of pleasant romances, of stirring incident, or moving
love-tales feel himself instinctively inclined to turn to Munich as to
the city of his dreams. On the other hand, it is by no means certain
that, if the choice of a stage for our performance were offered to the
most contented among us, we should be satisfied to speak our parts and
go through our actor's business upon the boards of this world. Some
would prefer to take their properties, their player's crowns and robes,
their aspiring expressions and their finely expressed aspirations before
the audience of a larger planet; others, perhaps the majority, would
choose, with more humility as well as with more common sense, the
shadowy scenery, the softer footlights and the less exigent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span> public of a
modest asteroid, beyond the reach of our earthly haste, of our noisy and
unclean high-roads to honour, of our furious chariot races round the
goals of fame, and, especially, beyond the reach of competition. But we
have no choice. We are in the world and, before we know where we are, we
are on one of the paths which we must traverse in our few score years
between birth and death. Moreover, each man's path leads up to the
theatre on the one side and down from it on the other. The inexorable
manager, Fate, requires that each should go through with his comedy or
his drama, if he be judged worthy of a leading part, with his scene or
his act in another man's piece, if he be fit only to play the walking
gentleman, the dumb footman, or the mechanically trained supernumerary
who does duty by turns as soldier, sailor, courtier, husbandman,
conspirator or red-capped patriot. A few play well, many play badly, all
must appear and the majority are feebly applauded and loudly hissed. He
counts himself great who is received with such an uproar of clapping and
shout of approval as may drown the voice of the discontented; he is
called fortunate who, having missed his cue and broken down in his
words, makes his exit in the triumphant train of the greater actor upon
whom all eyes are turned; he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span> is deemed happy who, having offended no
man, is allowed to depart in peace upon his downward road. Yet none of
these players need pride themselves much upon their success nor take to
heart their failure. Long before most of them have slipped into the
grave which waits at the foot of the hill, and have been wrapped
comfortably in the pleasant earth, their names are forgotten by those
who screamed with pleasure or hooted in disgust at their performance,
their faces are no longer remembered, their great drama is become an
old-fashioned mummery of the past. Why should they care? Their work is
done, they have been rewarded or punished, paid with praise and gold or
mulcted in the sum of their reputation and estate. Famous or infamous,
in honour or in disrepute, in riches or in poverty, they have reached
the end of their time, they are worn out, the world will have no more of
them, they are worthless in the price-scale of men, they must be buried
out of sight and they will be forgotten out of mind. The beginning is
the same for all, and the end also, and as for the future, who shall
tell us upon what basis of higher intelligence our brief passage across
the stage is to be judged? Why then should the present trouble our
vanity so greatly? And if our play is of so little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span> importance, why
should we care whether the scenery is romantic instead of commonplace,
or why should we make furious efforts to shift a Gothic castle, a
drawbridge, a moat and a waterfall into the slides occupied by the four
walls of a Munich tobacconist's shop?</p>

<p>There is not even anything especial in the appearance of the place to
recommend it to the ready pen of the word-painter. It is an
establishment of very modest pretensions situated in one of the side
streets leading to a great thoroughfare. As we are in Munich, however,
the side street is broad and clean, the pavement is well swept and the
adjoining houses have an air of solid respectability and wealth. At the
point where the street widens to an irregular shape on the downward
slope there is a neat little iron kiosque completely covered with
brilliant advertisements, printed in black Gothic letters upon red and
yellow paper. The point of vivid colour is not disagreeable, for it
relieves the neutral tints of brick and brown stone, and arrests the
eye, long wearied with the respectable parade of buildings. The
tobacconist's shop is, indeed, the most shabby, or, to speak more
correctly, the least smartly new among its fellow-shops, wherein dwell,
in consecutive order, a barber, a watchmaker,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span> a pastry-cook, a
shoemaker and a colour-man. In spite of its unattractive exterior,
however, the establishment of "Christian Fischelowitz, from South
Russia," enjoys a very considerable reputation. Within the high, narrow
shop there is good store of rare tobaccos, from the mild Kir to the
Imperial Samson, the aromatic Dubec and the pungent Swary. The dusty
window beside the narrow door exhibits, it is true, only a couple of
tall, dried tobacco plants set in flower-pots, a carelessly arranged
collection of cedar and pasteboard boxes for cigars and cigarettes, and
a fantastically constructed Swiss cottage, built entirely of cigarettes
and fine cut yellow leaf, with little pieces of glass set in for
windows. This effort of architecture is in a decidedly ruinous
condition, the little stuffed paper cylinders are ragged and torn, some
of them show signs of detaching themselves from the cardboard frame upon
which they are pasted, and the dust of years has accumulated upon the
bit of painted board which serves as a foundation for the chalet. In one
corner of the window an object more gaudy but not more useful attracts
the eye. It is the popular doll figure commonly known in Germany as the
"Wiener Gigerl" or "Vienna fop." It is doubtful whether any person could
appear in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span> the public places of Vienna in such a costume without being
stoned or otherwise painfully put to a shameful death. The doll is
arrayed in black shorts and silk stockings, a wide white waistcoat, a
scarlet evening coat, an enormous collar and a white tall hat with a
broad brim. He stands upon one foot, raising the other as though in the
act of beginning a minuet; he holds in one hand a stick and in the other
a cigarette, a relatively monstrous eye-glass magnifies one of his
painted eyes and upon his face is such an expression of combined
insolence, vulgarity, dishonesty and conceit as would insure his being
shot at sight in any Western American village making the least pretence
to self-respect. On high days and holidays Christian Fischelowitz
inserts a key into the square black pedestal whereon the doll has its
being, and the thing lives and moves, turns about and cocks its
impertinent head at the passers-by, while a feeble tune of uncertain
rhythm is heard grating itself out upon the teeth of the metal comb in
the concealed mechanism. Fischelowitz delights in this monstrosity, and
is never weary of watching its detestable antics. It is doubtful whether
in the simplicity of his good-natured heart he does not really believe
that the Wiener Gigerl may attract<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span> a stray customer to his counter and,
in the long-run, pay for itself. For it cost him money, and in itself,
as a thing of beauty, it hardly covers the bad debt contracted with him
by a poor fellow-countryman to whom he kindly lent fifty marks last
year. He accepted the doll without a murmur, however, in full discharge
of the obligation, and with an odd philosophy peculiar to himself, he
does his best to get what amusement he can out of the little red-coated
figure without complaining and without bitterness.</p>

<p>Christian's wife, his larger if not his better half, is less complacent.
In the publicity of the shop her small black eyes cast glances full of
hate upon the innocent Gigerl, her full flat face reddens with anger
when she remembers the money, and her fat hands would dash the insolent
little figure into the street, if her mercantile understanding did not
suggest the possibility of ultimately selling it for something. In view
of such a fortunate contingency, and whenever she is alone, she
carefully dusts the thing and puts it away in the cupboard in the
corner, well knowing that Fischelowitz will return in an hour, will take
it out, set it in its place, wind it up and watch its performance with
his everlasting, good-humoured, satisfied smile. In<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span> public she ventures
only to abuse the doll. In the silent watches of the night she directs
her sharp speeches at Christian himself. Not that she is altogether
miserly, nor by any means an ill-disposed person. Had she been of such a
disposition her husband would not have married her, for he is a very
good man of business and a keen judge of other wares besides tobacco.
She is a good mother and a good housewife, energetic, thrifty, and of
fairly even temper; but that particular piece of generosity which
resulted in the acquisition of a red-coated puppet in exchange for fifty
marks fills her heart with anger and her plump brown fingers with an
itching desire to scratch and tear something or somebody as a means of
satisfying her vengeance. For the poor fellow-countryman was one of the
Count's friends, and Akulina Fischelowitz abhors the Count and loathes
him, and the Wiener Gigerl was the beginning of the end.</p>

<p>While Christian is watching his doll, and Akulina is seated behind the
counter, her hands folded upon her lap, and her eyes darting unquiet
glances at her husband, the Count is busily occupied in making
cigarettes in the dingy back shop among a group of persons, both young
and old, all similarly occupied. It is not to be expected that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
workroom should be cleaner or more tastefully decorated than the
counting-house, and in such a business as the manufacture of cigarettes
by hand litter of all sorts accumulates rapidly. The "Famous Cigarette
Manufactory of Christian Fischelowitz from South Russia" is about as
dingy, as unhealthy, as untidy, as dusty a place as can be found within
the limits of tidy, well-to-do Munich. The room is lighted by a window
and a half-glazed door, both opening upon a dark court. The walls,
originally whitewashed, are of a deep rich brown, attributable partly to
the constant fumes and exhalations of tobacco, partly to the fine brown
dust of the dried refuse cuttings, and partly to the admirable
smoke-giving qualities of the rickety iron stove which stands in one
corner, and in which a fire is daily attempted during more than half the
year. There are many shelves upon the walls too, and the white wood of
these has also received into itself the warm, deep colour. Upon two of
these shelves there are accumulations of useless articles, a cracked
glass vase, once the pride of the show window, when it was filled to
overflowing with fine cut leaf, a broken-down samovar which has seen
tea-service in many cities, from Kiew to Moscow, from Moscow to Vilna,
from Vilna to Berlin, from Berlin to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span> Munich; there are fragments of
Russian lacquered wooden bowls, wrecked cigar-boxes, piles of dingy
handbills left over from the last half-yearly advertisement, a crazy
Turkish narghile, the broken stem of a chibouque, an old hat and an odd
boot, besides irregularly shaped parcels, wrapped in crumpled brown
paper and half buried in dust. Upon the other shelves are arranged more
neatly rows of tin boxes with locks, and reams of still uncut cigarette
paper, some white, some straw-coloured.</p>

<p>Round about the room are the seats of the workers. One man alone is
standing at his task, a man with a dark, Cossack face, high cheek-bones,
honest, gleaming black eyes, straggling hair and ragged beard. In his
shirt-sleeves, his arms bare to the elbow, he handles the heavy swivel
knife, pressing the package of carefully arranged leaves forward and
under the blade by almost imperceptible degrees. It is one of the most
delicate operations in the art, and the man has an especial gift for the
work. So sensitive is his strong right hand that as the knife cuts
through the thick pile he can detect the presence of a scrap of thin
paper amongst the tobacco, and not a bit of hardened stem or a twisted
leaf escapes him. It is very hard work, even for a strong man, and the
moisture stands in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span> great drops on his dark forehead as he carefully
presses the sharp instrument through the resisting substance, quickly
lifts it up again and pushes on the package for the next cut.</p>

<p>At a small black table near by sits a Polish girl, poorly dressed, her
heavy red-brown hair braided in one long neat tress, her face deadly
white, her blue eyes lustreless and sunken, her thin fingers actively
rolling bits of paper round a glass tube, drawing them off as the edges
are gummed together, and laying them in a prettily arranged pile before
her. She is Vjera, the shell-maker, invariably spoken of as "poor
Vjera." Vjera, being interpreted from the Russian, means "Faith." There
is an odd and pathetic irony in the name borne by the sickly girl.
Faith&mdash;faith in what? In shell-making? In Christian Fischelowitz? In
Johann Schmidt, the Cossack tobacco-cutter, whose real name is lost in
the gloom of many dim wanderings? In life? In death? Who knows? In God,
at least, poor child&mdash;and in her wretched existence there is little else
left for her to believe in. If you ask her whether she believes in the
Count, she will turn away rather hastily, but in that case the wish to
believe is there.</p>

<p>Beside Vjera sits another girl, less pale perhaps,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span> but more
insignificant in feature, and similarly occupied, with this slight
difference that the little cylinders she makes are straw-coloured when
Vjera is making white ones, and white when her companion is using
straw-coloured paper. On the opposite side of the room, also before
small black tables, sit two men, to wit, Victor Ivanowitch Dumnoff and
the Count. It is their business to shape the tobacco and to insert it
into the shells, a process performed by rolling the cut leaf into a
cylinder in a tongue-shaped piece of parchment, which, when ready, has
the form of a pencil, and is slipped into the shell. The parchment is
then withdrawn, and the tobacco remains behind in its place; the little
bunch of threads which protrudes at each end is cut off with sharp
scissors and the cigarette is finished.</p>

<p>The Count, on the afternoon of the day on which this story opens, was
sitting before his little black table in his usual attitude, his head
stooping slightly forward, his elbows supported on each side of him, his
long fingers moving quickly and skilfully, his greyish blue eyes fixed
intently on his work. At five o'clock in the afternoon on Tuesday, the
sixth of May, in the present year of grace one thousand eight hundred
and ninety, the Count was rapidly approaching the two-thousandth
cigarette<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span> of that day's work. Two thousand in a day was his limit; and
though he boasted that he could make three thousand between dawn and
midnight, if absolutely necessary, yet he confessed that among the last
five hundred a few might be found in which the leaves would be too
tightly rolled or too loosely packed. Up to his limit, however, he was
to be relied upon, and not one of his hundred score of cigarettes would
be found to differ in weight from another by a single grain.</p>

<p>It is perhaps time to describe the outward appearance of the busy
worker, out of whose life the events of some six-and-thirty hours
furnish the subject of this little tale. The Count is thirty years old,
but might be thought older, for there are grey streaks in his smooth
black hair, and there is a grey tone in the complexion of his tired
face. In figure he is thin, broad shouldered, sinewy, well made and
graceful. He moves easily and with a certain elegance. His arms and legs
are long in proportion to his body. His head is well shaped, bony, full
of energy&mdash;his nose is finely modelled and sharply aquiline; a short,
dark moustache does not quite hide the firm, well-chiselled lips, and
the clean-cut chin is prominent and of the martial type. From under his
rather heavy eyebrows a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span> pair of keen eyes, full of changing light and
expression, look somewhat contemptuously on the world and its
inhabitants. On the whole, the Count is a handsome man and looks a
gentleman, in spite of his occupation and in spite of his clothes, which
are in the fashion of twenty years ago, but are carefully brushed and
all but spotless. There are poor men who can wear a coat as a red Indian
will ride a mustang which a white man has left for dead, beyond the
period predetermined by the nature of tailoring as the natural term of
existence allotted to earthly garments. We look upon a centenarian as a
miracle of longevity, and he is careful to tell us his age if he have
not lost the power of speech; but if the coats of poor men could speak,
how much more marvellous in our eyes would their powers of life appear!
A stranger would have taken the Count for a half-pay officer of good
birth in straitened circumstances. The expression of his face at the
time in question was grave and thoughtful, as though he were thinking of
matters weightier to his happiness, if not more necessary to his
material welfare than his work. He saw his fingers moving, he watched
each honey-coloured bundle of cut leaf as it was rolled in the parchment
tongue, and with unswerving regularity<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span> he made the motions required to
slip the tobacco into the shell. But, while seeing all that he did, and
seeing consciously, he looked as though he saw also through the familiar
materials shaped under his fingers, into a dim distance full of a larger
life and wider interests.</p>

<p>The five occupants of the workshop had been working in silence for
nearly half an hour. The two girls on the one side and the two men on
the other kept their eyes bent down upon their fingers, while Johann
Schmidt, the Cossack, plied his guillotine-like knife in the corner.
This same Johann Schmidt, whose real name, to judge from his appearance,
might have been Tarass Bulba or Danjelo Buralbash, and was probably of a
similar sound, was at once the wit, the spendthrift and the humanitarian
of the Fischelowitz manufactory, possessing a number of good qualities
in such abundant measure as to make him a total failure in everything
except the cutting of tobacco. Like many witty, generous and
kind-hearted persons in a much higher rank of existence, he was cursed
with a total want of tact. On the present occasion, having sliced
through an unusually long package of leaves and having encountered an
exceptional number of obstacles in doing so, he thought fit to pause,
draw a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span> long breath and wipe the perspiration from his sallow forehead
with a pocket-handkerchief in which the neutral tints predominated. This
operation, preparatory to a rest of ten minutes, having been
successfully accomplished, Tarass Bulba Schmidt picked up a tiny oblong
bit of paper which had found its way to his feet from one of the girls'
tables, took a pinch of the freshly cut tobacco beside him and rolled a
cigarette in his palm with one hand while he felt in his pocket for a
match with the other. Then, in the midst of a great cloud of fragrant
smoke, he sat down upon the edge of his cutting-block and looked at his
companions. After a few moments of deep thought he gave expression to
his meditations in bad German. It is curious to see how readily the
Slavs in Germany fall into the habit of using the language of the
country when conversing together.</p>

<p>"It is my opinion," he said at last, "that the most objectless
existences are those which most exactly accomplish the object set before
them."</p>

<p>Having given vent to this bit of paradox, Johann inhaled as much smoke
as his leathery lungs could contain and relapsed into silence. Vjera,
the Polish girl, glanced at the tobacco-cutter and went on with her
work. The insignificant girl beside her giggled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span> vacantly. Dumnoff did
not seem to have heard the remark.</p>

<p>"Nineteen hundred and twenty-three," muttered the Count between his
teeth and in Russian, as the nineteenth hundred and twenty-third
cigarette rolled from his fingers, and he took up the parchment tongue
for the nineteenth hundred and twenty-fourth time that day.</p>

<p>"I do not exactly understand you, Herr Schmidt," said Vjera without
looking up again. "An objectless life has no object. How then&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There is nothing to understand," growled Dumnoff, who never counted his
own work, and always enjoyed a bit of conversation, provided he could
abuse something or somebody. "There is nothing in it, and Herr Schmidt
is a Landau moss-head."</p>

<p>It would be curious to ascertain why the wiseacres of eastern Bavaria
are held throughout South Germany in such contempt as to be a byword for
dulness and stupidity. The Cossack's dark eyes shot a quick glance at
the Russian, but he took no notice of the remark.</p>

<p>"I mean," he said, after a pause, "exactly what I say. I am an honest
fellow, and I always mean what I say, and no offence to anybody. Do we
not all of us, here with Fischelowitz, exactly fulfil the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span> object set
before us, I would like to ask? Do we not make cigarettes from morning
till night with horrible exactness and regularity? Very well. Do we not,
at the same time, lead an atrociously objectless existence?"</p>

<p>"The object of existence is to live," remarked Dumnoff, who was fond of
cabbage and strong spirits, and of little else in the world. The Cossack
laughed.</p>

<p>"Do you call this living?" he asked contemptuously. Then the
good-humoured tone returned to his voice, and he shrugged his bony
shoulders as he crossed one leg over the other and took another puff.</p>

<p>"Nineteen hundred and twenty-nine," said the Count.</p>

<p>"Do you call that a life for a Christian man?" asked Schmidt again,
looking at him and waving towards him the lighted cigarette he held. "Is
that a life for a gentleman, for a real Count, for a noble, for an
educated aristocrat, for a man born to be the heir of millions?"</p>

<p>"Thirty," said the Count. "No, it is not. But there is no reason why you
should remind us of the fact, that I know of. It is bad enough to be
obliged to do the thing, without being made to talk about it. Not that
it matters to me so much to-day as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span> it did a year ago, as you may
imagine. Thirty-one. It will soon be over for me, at least. In fact I
only finish these two thousand out of kindness to Fischelowitz, because
I know he has a large order to deliver on the day after to-morrow. And,
besides, a gentleman must keep his word even&mdash;thirty-two&mdash;in the matter
of making cigarettes for other people. But the work on this batch shall
be a parting gift of my goodwill to Fischelowitz, who is an honest
fellow and has understood my painful situation all along. To-morrow at
this time, I shall be far away. Thirty-three."</p>

<p>The Count drew a long breath of relief in the anticipation of his
release from captivity and hard labour. Vjera dropped her glass tube and
her little pieces of paper and looked sadly at him, while he was
speaking.</p>

<p>"By the by," observed the Cossack, "to-day is Tuesday. I had quite
forgotten. So you really leave us to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Yes. It is all settled at last, and I have had letters. It is
to-morrow&mdash;and this is my last hundred."</p>

<p>"At what time?" inquired Dumnoff, with a rough laugh. "Is it to be in
the morning or in the afternoon?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>"I do not know," answered the Count, quietly and with an air of
conviction. "It will certainly be before night."</p>

<p>"Provided you get the news in time to ask us to the feast," jeered the
other, "we shall all be as happy as you yourself."</p>

<p>"Thirty-four," said the Count, who had rolled the last cigarette very
slowly and thoughtfully.</p>

<p>Vjera cast an imploring look on Dumnoff, as though beseeching him not to
continue his jesting. The rough man, who might have sat for the type of
the Russian mujik, noticed the glance and was silent.</p>

<p>"Who is incredulous enough to disbelieve this time?" asked the Cossack,
gravely. "Besides, the Count says that he has had letters, so it is
certain, at last."</p>

<p>"Love-letters, he means," giggled the insignificant girl, who rejoiced
in the name of Anna Schmigjelskova. Then she looked at Vjera as though
afraid of her displeasure.</p>

<p>But Vjera took no notice of the silly speech and sat idle for some
minutes, gazing at the Count with an expression in which love,
admiration and pity were very oddly mingled. Pale and ill as she looked,
there was a ray of light and a movement of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span> life in her face during
those few moments. Then she took again her glass tube and her bits of
paper and resumed her task of making shells, with a little heave of her
thin chest that betrayed the suppression of a sigh.</p>

<p>The Count finished his second thousand, and arranged the last hundreds
neatly with the others, laying them in little heaps and patting the ends
with his fingers so that they should present an absolutely symmetrical
appearance. Dumnoff plodded on, in his peculiar way, doing the work well
and then carelessly tossing it into a basket by his side. He was capable
of working fourteen hours at a stretch when there was a prospect of
cabbage soup and liquor in the evening. The Cossack cleaned his
cutting-block and his broad swivel knife and emptied the cut tobacco
into a clean tin box. It was clear that the day's work was almost at an
end for all present. At that moment Fischelowitz entered with jaunty
step and smiling face, jingling a quantity of loose silver in his hand.
He is a little man, rotund and cheerful, quiet of speech and sunny in
manner, with a brown beard and waving dark hair, arranged in the manner
dear to barbers' apprentices. He has very soft brown eyes, a healthy
complexion and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span> a nose the inverse of aquiline, for it curves upwards to
its sharp point, as though perpetually snuffing after the pleasant
fragrance of his favourite "Dubec otborny."</p>

<p>"Well, my children," he said, with a slight stammer that somehow lent an
additional kindliness to his tone, "what has the day's work been? You
first, Herr Graf," he added, turning to the Count. "I suppose that you
have made a thousand at least?"</p>

<p>Fischelowitz possessed in abundance the tact which was lacking in Johann
Schmidt, the Cossack. He well knew that the Count had made double the
quantity, but he also knew that the latter enjoyed the small triumph of
producing twice what seemed to be expected of him.</p>

<p>"Two thousand, Herr Fischelowitz," he said, proudly. Then seeing that
his employer was counting out the sum of six marks, he made a
deprecating gesture, as though refusing all payment.</p>

<p>"No," he said, with great dignity, and rising from his seat. "No. You
must allow me, on this occasion, to refuse the honorarium usual under
the circumstances."</p>

<p>"And why, my dear Count?" inquired Fischelowitz, shaking the six marks
in one hand and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span> remainder of his money in the other, as though
weighing the silver. "And why will you refuse me the honour&mdash;"</p>

<p>The other working people exchanged glances of amusement, as though they
knew what was coming. Vjera hid her face in her hands as she rested her
elbows on the table before her.</p>

<p>"I must indeed explain," answered the Count. "To-morrow, I shall be
obliged to leave you, not to return to the occupation which has so long
been a necessity to me in my troubles. Fortune at last returns to me and
I am free. I think I have spoken to you in confidence of my situation,
once at least, if not more often. My difficulties are at an end. I have
received letters announcing that to-morrow I shall be reinstated in my
possessions. You have shown me kindness&mdash;kindness, Herr Fischelowitz,
and, what has been more than kindness to me, you have shown me great
courtesy. Every one has not treated the poor gentleman with the same
forbearance. But let bygones be bygones. On the occasion of my return to
prosperity, permit me to offer you, as the only gift as yet within my
means, the result of my last day's work within these walls. You have
been very kind, and I thank you very sincerely."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a tremor in the Count's voice, and a moisture in his eyes, as
he drew himself up in his threadbare decent frock-coat and held out his
sinewy hand, stained with the long handling of tobacco in his daily
labour. Fischelowitz smiled with uncommon cheerfulness as he grasped the
bony fingers heartily.</p>

<p>"Thank you," he said. "I accept. I esteem it an honour to have been of
any assistance to you in your temporary annoyances."</p>

<p>Vjera still hid her face. The Cossack watched what was happening with an
expression half sad, half curious, and Dumnoff displayed a set of
ferocious white teeth as he stupidly grinned from ear to ear.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>
</div>

<p>Fischelowitz paid each worker for the day's work, in his quick, cheerful
way, and each, being paid, passed out through the front shop into the
street. Five minutes later the Count was strolling along the
Maximilians-strasse in the direction of the royal palace. As he walked
he drew himself up to the full height of his military figure and looked
into the faces of the passers in the way with grave dignity. At that
hour there were many people abroad, slim lieutenants in the green
uniforms of the Uhlans and in the blue coats and crimson facings of the
heavy cavalry, superior officers with silver or gold plated epaulettes,
slim maidens and plump matrons, beardless students in bright, coloured
caps, and solemn, elderly civilians with great beards and greater
spectacles, great Munich burghers and little Munich nobles, gaily
dressed children of all ages, dogs of every breed from the Saint Bernard
to the crooked-jointed Dachs, perambulators not a few and legions of
nursery-maids. Most of the people who passed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span> cast a glance at the
thoroughbred-looking man in the threadbare frock-coat who looked at them
all with such an air of quiet superiority, carrying his head so high and
putting down his feet with such a firm tread. There were doubtless those
among the crowd who saw in the tired face the indications of a
life-story not without interest, for the crowd was not, nor ever is, in
Munich, lacking in intelligent and observant persons. But in all the
multitude there was not one man or woman who knew the name of the
individual to whom the face belonged, and there were few who would have
risked the respectability of their social position by making the
acquaintance of a man so evidently poor, even if the occasion had
presented itself.</p>

<p>But presently a figure was seen moving swiftly through the throng in the
direction already taken by the Count, a figure of a type much more
familiar to the sight of the Munich stroller, for it was that of a
poorly dressed girl with a long plait of red-brown hair, carrying a
covered brown straw basket upon one arm and hurrying along with the
noiseless tread possible only in the extreme old age of shoes that were
never strong. Poor Vjera had been sent by Fischelowitz with a thousand
cigarettes to be delivered at one of the hotels. She was generally<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
employed upon like errands, because she was the poorest in the
establishment, and those who received the wares gave her a few pence for
her trouble. She sped quickly onward, until she suddenly found herself
close behind the Count. Then she slackened her pace and crept along as
noiselessly as possible, her eyes fixed upon him as she walked and
evidently doing her best not to overtake him nor to be seen by him. As
luck would have it, however, the Count suddenly stood still before the
show window of a picture-dealer's shop. A clever painting of a solitary
Cossack riding along a stony mountain road, by Josef Brandt, had
attracted his attention. Then as he realised that he had looked at the
picture a dozen times during the previous week, his eye wandered, and in
the reflection of the plate-glass window he caught sight of Vjera's
slight form at no great distance from him. He turned sharply upon his
heels and met her eyes, taking off his limp hat with a courteous
gesture.</p>

<p>"Permit me," he said, laying his hand upon the basket and trying to take
it from her.</p>

<p>Poor Vjera's face flushed suddenly, and her grip tightened upon the
straw handle and she refused to let it go.</p>

<p>"No, you shall never do that again," she said, quickly, trying to draw
back from him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p>"And why not? Why should I not do you a service?"</p>

<p>"The other day you took it&mdash;the people stared at you&mdash;they never stare
at me, for I am only a poor girl&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And what are the people or what is their staring to me?" asked the
Count, quietly. "I am not afraid of being taken for a servant or a
porter, because I carry a lady's parcel. Pray give me the basket."</p>

<p>"Oh no, pray let it be," cried Vjera, in great earnest. "I cannot bear
to see you with such a thing in your hand."</p>

<p>They were still standing before the picture-dealer's window, while many
people passed along the pavement. In trying to draw away, Vjera found
herself suddenly in the stream, and just then a broad-shouldered officer
who chanced to be looking the other way came into collision with her, so
roughly that she was forced almost into the Count's arms. The latter
made a step forward.</p>

<p>"Is it your habit to jostle ladies in that way?" he asked in a sharp
tone, addressing the stout lieutenant.</p>

<p>The latter muttered something which might be taken for an apology and
passed on, having no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span> intention of being drawn into a street quarrel
with an odd-looking individual who, from his accent, was evidently a
foreigner. The Count's eyes darted an angry glance after the offender,
and then he looked again at Vjera. In the little accident he had got
possession of the basket. Thereupon he passed it to his left hand and
offered Vjera his right arm.</p>

<p>"Did the insolent fellow hurt you?" he asked anxiously, in Polish.</p>

<p>"Oh no&mdash;only give me my basket!" Vjera's face was painfully flushed.</p>

<p>"No, my dear child," said the Count, gravely. "You will not deny me the
pleasure of accompanying you and of carrying your burden. Afterwards, if
you will, we can take a little walk together, before I see you to your
home."</p>

<p>"You are always so kind to me," answered the girl, bending her head, as
though to hide her burning cheeks, but submitting at last to his will.</p>

<p>For some minutes they walked on in silence. Then Vjera showed by a
gesture that she wished to cross the street, on the other side of which
was situated one of the principal hotels of the city. In front of the
entrance Vjera put out her hand entreatingly towards her basket, but the
Count took no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span> notice of the attempt and resolutely ascended the steps
of the porch by her side. Behind the swinging glass door stood the huge
porter amply endowed with that military appearance so characteristic of
all men in Germany who wear anything of the nature of an official
costume.</p>

<p>"The lady has a package for some one here," said the Count, holding out
the basket.</p>

<p>"For the head waiter," said Vjera, timidly.</p>

<p>The porter took the basket, set it down, touched the button of an
electric bell and silently looked at the pair with the malignant
scrutiny which is the prerogative of servants in their manner with those
whom they are privileged to consider as their inferiors. Presently,
however, meeting the Count's cold stare, he turned away and strolled up
the vestibule. A moment later the head waiter appeared, glorious in a
perfectly new evening coat and a phenomenal shirt front.</p>

<p>"Ah, my cigarettes!" he exclaimed briskly, and the Count heard the chink
of the nickel pence, as the head waiter inserted two fat white fingers
into the pocket of his exceedingly fashionable waistcoat.</p>

<p>The sight which must follow was one which the Count was anxious not to
see. He therefore turned his back and pretended to brush from his sleeve
a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span> speck of dust revealed to his searching eye in the strong afternoon
light which streamed through the open door. Then Vjera's low-spoken word
of thanks and her light tread made him aware that she had received her
little gratuity; he stood politely aside while she passed out, and then
went down the half-dozen steps with her. As they began to move up the
street, he did not offer her his arm again.</p>

<p>"You are so kind, so kind to me," said poor Vjera. "How can I ever thank
you!"</p>

<p>"Between you and me there is no question of thanks," answered her
companion. "Or if there is to be such a question it should arise in
another way. It is for me to thank you."</p>

<p>"For what?"</p>

<p>"For many things, all of which have proceeded from your kindness of
heart and have resulted in making my life bearable during the past
months&mdash;or years. I keep little account of time. How long is it since I
have been making cigarettes for Fischelowitz, at the rate of three marks
a thousand?"</p>

<p>"Ever since I can remember," answered Vjera. "It is six years since I
came to work there as a little girl."</p>

<p>"Six years? That is not possible! You must be mistaken, it cannot be so
long."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p>Vjera said nothing, but turned her face away with an expression of pain.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is a long time, since all that happened," said the Count,
thoughtfully. "I was a young man then, I am old now."</p>

<p>"Old! How can you say anything so untrue!" Vjera exclaimed with
considerable indignation.</p>

<p>"Yes, I am old. It is no wonder. We say at home that 'strange earth dies
without wind.' A foreign land will make old bones of a man without the
help of years. That is what Germany has done for me. And yet, how much
older I should be but for you, dear Vjera! Shall we sit down here, in
this quiet place, under the trees? You know it is all over to-morrow,
and I am free at last. I would like to tell you my story."</p>

<p>Vjera, who was tired of the close atmosphere of the workroom and whose
strength was not enough to let her walk far with pleasure, sat down upon
the green bench willingly enough, but the nervous look of pain had not
disappeared from her face.</p>

<p>"Is it of any use to tell it to me again?" she asked, sadly, as she
leaned against the painted backboard.</p>

<p>The Count produced a cigarette and gravely lighted it, before he
answered her, and when he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span> spoke he seemed to attach little or no
importance to her question.</p>

<p>"You see," he said, "it is all different now, and I can look at it from
a different point of view. Formerly when I spoke of it, I am afraid that
I spoke bitterly, for, of course, I could not foresee that it could all
come right again so soon, so very soon. And now that this weary time is
over I can look back upon it with some pride, if with little
pleasure&mdash;save for the part you have played in my life, and&mdash;may I say
it?&mdash;saving the part I have played in yours."</p>

<p>He put out his hand gently and tenderly touched hers, and there was
something in the meeting of those two thin, yellow hands, stained with
the same daily labour and not meeting for the first time thus, that sent
a thrill to the two hearts and that might have brought a look of
thoughtful interest into eyes dulled and wearied by the ordinary sights
of this world. Vjera did not resent the innocent caress, but the colour
that came into her face was not of the same hue as that which had burned
there when he had insisted upon carrying her basket. This time the blush
was not painful to see, but rather shed a faint light of beauty over the
plain, pale features. Poor Vjera was happy for a moment.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am very glad if I have been anything to you," she said. "I would I
might have been more."</p>

<p>"More? I do not see&mdash;you have been gentle, forbearing, respecting my
misfortunes and trying to make others respect them. What more could you
have done, or what more could you have been?"</p>

<p>Vjera was silent, but she softly withdrew her hand from his and gazed at
the people in the distance. The Count smoked without speaking, for
several minutes, closing his eyes as though revolving a great problem in
his mind, then glancing sidelong at his companion's face, hesitating as
though about to speak, checking himself and shutting his eyes again in
meditation. Holding his cigarette between his teeth he clasped his
fingers together tightly, unclasped them again and let his arms fall on
each side of him. At last he turned sharply, as though resolved what to
do.</p>

<p>He believed that he was on the very eve of recovering a vast fortune and
of resuming a high position in the world. It was no wonder that there
was a struggle in his soul, when at that moment a new complication
seemed to present itself. He was indeed sure that he did not love Vjera,
and in the brilliant dreams which floated before his half-closed eyes,
visions of beautiful and high-born women<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span> dazzled him with their smiles
and enchanted him by the perfect grace of their movements. To-morrow he
might choose his wife among such as they. But to-day Vjera was by his
side, poor Vjera, who alone of those he had known during the years of
his captivity had stood by him, had felt for him, had given him a sense
of reliance in her perfect sincerity and honest affection. And her
affection had grown into something more; it had developed into love
during the last months. He had seen it, had known it and had done
nothing to arrest the growth. Nay, he had done worse. Only a moment ago
he had taken her hand in a way which might well mislead an innocent
girl. The Count, according to his lights, was the very incarnation of
the theory, honour, in the practice, honesty. His path was clear. If he
had deceived Vjera in the very smallest accent of word or detail of deed
he must make instant reparation. This was the reason why he turned
sharply in his seat and looked at her with a look which was certainly
kind, but which was, perhaps, more full of determination than of
lover-like tenderness.</p>

<p>"Vjera," he said, slowly, pausing on every syllable of his speech, "will
you be my wife?"</p>

<p>Vjera looked at him long and shook her head in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span> silence. Instead of
blushing, she turned pale, changing colour with that suddenness which
belongs to delicate or exhausted organisations. The Count did not heed
the plain though unspoken negation and continued to speak very slowly
and earnestly, choosing his words and rounding his expressions as though
he were making a declaration to a young princess instead of asking a
poor Polish girl to marry him. He even drew himself together, as it
were, with the movement of dignity which was habitual with him,
straightening his back, squaring his shoulders and leaning slightly
forward in his seat. As he began to speak again, Vjera clasped her hands
upon her knees and looked down at the gravel of the public path.</p>

<p>"I am in earnest," he said. "To-morrow, all those rights to which I was
born will be restored to me, and I shall enjoy what the world calls a
great position. Am I so deeply indebted to the world that I must submit
to all its prejudices and traditions? Has the world given me anything,
in exchange for which it becomes my duty to consult its caprices, or its
social superstitions? Surely not. To whom am I most indebted, to the
world which has turned its back on me during a temporary embarrassment
and loss of fortune, or to my friend<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span> Vjera who has been faithfully kind
all along? The question itself is foolish. I owe everything to Vjera,
and nothing to the world. The case is simple, the argument is short and
the verdict is plain. I will not take the riches and the dignities which
will be mine by this time to-morrow to the feet of some high-born lady
who, to-day, would look coldly on me because I am not&mdash;not quite in the
fashion, so far as outward appearance is concerned. But I will and I do
offer all, wealth, title, dignity, everything to Vjera. And she shakes
her head, and with a single gesture refuses it all. Why? Has she a
reason to give? An argument to set up? A sensible ground for her
decision? No, certainly not."</p>

<p>As he looked gravely towards her averted face, Vjera again shook her
head, slowly and thoughtfully, with an air of unalterable determination.
He seemed surprised at her obstinacy and watched her in silence for a
few moments.</p>

<p>"I see," he said at last, very sadly. "You think that I do not love
you." Vjera made no sign, and a long pause followed during which the
Count's features expressed great perplexity.</p>

<p>The day was drawing to its close and the low sun shot level rays through
the trees of the Hofgarten,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span> far above the heads of the laughing
children, the gossiping nurses and the slowly moving crowd that filled
the pavement along the drive in front of the palace. Vjera and the Count
were seated on a bench which was now already in the shade. The air was
beginning to grow chilly, but neither of them heeded the change.</p>

<p>"You think that I do not love you," said the Count again. "You are
mistaken, deeply mistaken, Vjera."</p>

<p>The faint, soft colour rose in the poor girl's waxen cheeks, and there
was an unaccustomed light in her weary blue eyes as they met his.</p>

<p>"I do not say," continued her companion, "that I love you as boys love
at twenty. I am past that. I am not a young man any more, and I have had
misfortunes such as would have broken the hearts of most men, and of the
kind that do not dispose to great love-passion. If my troubles had come
to me through the love of a woman&mdash;it might have been otherwise. As it
is&mdash;do you think that I have no love for you, Vjera? Do not think that,
dear&mdash;do not let me see that you think it, for it would hurt me. There
is much for you, much, very much."</p>

<p>"To-day," answered Vjera, sadly, "but not to-morrow."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p>"You are cruel, without meaning to be even unkind," said the Count in an
unsteady voice. This time it was Vjera who took his hand in hers and
pressed it.</p>

<p>"God forbid that I should have an unkind thought for you," she said,
very tenderly.</p>

<p>The Count turned to her again and there was a moisture in his eyes of
which he was unconscious.</p>

<p>"Then believe that I do truly love you, Vjera," he answered. "Believe
that all that there is to give you, I give, and that my all is not a
little. I love you, child, in a way&mdash;ah, well, you have your girlish
dreams of love, and it is right that you should have them and it would
be very wrong to destroy them. But they shall not be destroyed by me,
and surely not by any other man, while I live. I shall grow young again,
I will grow young for you, for, in years at least, I am not old. I will
be a boy for you, Vjera, and I will love as boys love, but with the
strength of a man who has known sorrow and overlived it. You shall not
feel that in taking me you are taking a father, a protector, a man to
whom your youth seems childhood, and your youthfulness childish folly.
No, no&mdash;I will be more than that to you, I will be all to you that you
are to me, and more, and more, each day, till love<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span> has made us of one
age, of one mind, of one heart. Do you not believe that all this shall
be? Speak, dear. What is there yet behind in your thoughts?"</p>

<p>"I cannot tell. I wish I knew." Vjera's answer was scarcely audible and
she turned her face from him.</p>

<p>"And yet, there is something, you are keeping something from me, when I
have kept nothing from you. Why is it? Why do you not quite trust me and
believe in me? I can make you happy, now. Yesterday it was different and
so it was in all the yesterdays of yesterdays. I had nothing to offer
you but myself."</p>

<p>"It were best so," said Vjera in a low voice.</p>

<p>The Count was silent. There was something in her manner which he could
not understand, or rather, as he fancied, there was something in his own
brain which prevented him from understanding a very simple matter, and
he grew impatient with himself. At the same time he felt more and more
strongly drawn to the young girl at his side. As the sun went down and
the evening shadows deepened, he saw more in her face than he had been
accustomed to see there. Every line of the pale features so familiar to
his sight in his everyday life, reminded him of moments in the recent
past when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span> he had been wretchedly unhappy, and when the kindly look in
Vjera's face had comforted him and made life seem less unbearable. In
his dreary world she alone had shown that she cared whether he lived or
died, were insulted or respected, were treated like a dog or like a
Christian man. The kindness of his employer was indeed undeniable, but
it was of the sort which grated upon the sensitive nature of the
unfortunate cigarette-maker, for it was in itself vulgarly cheerful,
assuming that, after all, the Count should be contented with his lot.
But Vjera had always seemed to understand him, to feel for him, to
foresee his sensibilities as it were, and to be prepared for them. In a
measure appreciable to himself she admired him, and admiration alone can
make pity palatable to the proud. In her eyes his constancy under
misfortune was as admirable as his misfortunes themselves were worthy of
commiseration. In her eyes he was a gentleman, and one who had a right
to hold his head high among the best. When he was poorest, he had felt
himself to be in her eyes a hero. Are there many men who can resist the
charm of the one woman who believes them to be heroic? Are not most men,
too, really better for the trust and faith that is placed in them by
others, as the earthen vessel, valueless in itself,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span> becomes a thing of
prize and beauty under the loving hand of the artist who draws graceful
figures upon it and colours it skilfully, and handles it tenderly?</p>

<p>And now the poor man was puzzled and made anxious by the girl's
obstinate rejection of his offer. A chilly thought took shape in his
mind and pained him exceedingly.</p>

<p>"Vjera," he said at last, "I see how it is. You have never loved me. You
have only pitied me. You are good and kind, Vjera, but I wish it had
been otherwise."</p>

<p>He spoke very quietly, in a subdued tone, and the moisture which had
been more than once in his eyes since he had sat down beside the young
girl, now almost took the shape of a tear. He was wounded in his
innocent vanity, in the last stronghold of his fast-fading
individuality. But Vjera turned quickly at the words and a momentary
fire illuminated her pale blue eyes and dispelled the misty veil that
seemed to dull them.</p>

<p>"Whatever you say, do not say that!" she exclaimed. "I love you with all
my heart&mdash;I&mdash;ah, if you only understood, if you only knew, if you only
guessed!"</p>

<p>"That is it," answered the Count. "If I only<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span> could&mdash;but there is
something that passes my understanding."</p>

<p>The look of pain faded from his face and gave way to a bright smile, so
bright, so rare, that it restored in the magic of an instant the
freshness of early youth to the weary mask of sorrow. Then he covered
his eyes with his hands as though searching his memory for something he
could not find.</p>

<p>"What is it?" he asked, after a short pause and looking suddenly at
Vjera. "It is something I ought to remember and yet something I have
quite forgotten. Help me, Vjera, tell me what you are thinking of, and I
will explain it all."</p>

<p>"I was thinking of this day a week ago," said Vjera, and a little sob
escaped her as she quickly looked away.</p>

<p>"A week ago? Let me see&mdash;what happened a week ago? But why should I ask?
Nothing ever happens to me, nothing until now! And now, oh Vjera, it is
you who do not understand, it is you who do not know, who cannot guess."</p>

<p>As if he had forgotten everything else in the sudden realisation of his
return to liberty and fortune, he began to speak quickly and excitedly
in a tone louder and clearer than that of his ordinary voice.</p>

<p>"No," he cried, "you can never guess what this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span> change is to me. You can
never know what I enjoy in the thought of being myself again, you cannot
understand what it is to have been rich and great, and to be poor and
wretched and to regain wealth and dignity again by the stroke of a pen
in the vibration of a second. And yet it is true, all true, I tell you,
to-day, at last, after so much waiting. To-morrow they will come to my
lodging to fetch me&mdash;a court carriage or two, and many officials who
will treat me with the old respect I was used to long ago. They will
come up my little staircase, bringing money, immense quantities of
money, and the papers and the parchments and the seals. How they will
stare at my poor lodging, for they have never known that I have been so
wretched. Yes, one will bring money in a black leathern case&mdash;I know
just how it will look&mdash;and another will have with him a box full of
documents&mdash;all lawfully mine&mdash;and a third will bring my orders, that I
once wore, and with them the order of Saint Alexander Nevsky and a
letter on broad heavy paper, signed Alexander Alexandrovitch, signed by
the Tsar himself, Vjera. And I shall go with them to be received in
audience by the Prince Regent here, before I leave for Petersburg. And
then, after dinner, in the evening, I will get into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span> my special carriage
in the express train and my servants will make me comfortable and then
away, away, a night, and a day and another night and perhaps a few hours
more and I shall be at home at last, in my own great, beautiful home,
far out in the glorious country among the woods and the streams and the
birds; and I shall be driven in an open carriage with four horses up
from the village through the great avenue of poplars to the grand old
house. But before I go in I will go to the tomb&mdash;yes, I will go to the
tomb among the trees, and I will say a prayer for my father and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Your father?" Vjera started slightly. She had listened to the long
catalogue of the poor man's anticipations with a sad, unchanging face,
as though she had heard it all before. But at the mention of his
father's death she seemed surprised.</p>

<p>"Yes. He is dead at last, and my brother died on the same day. I have
had letters. There was a disease abroad in the village. They caught it
and they died. And now everything is mine, everything, the lands and the
houses and the money, all, all mine. But I will say a prayer for them,
now that they are dead and I shall never see them again. God knows, they
treated me ill when they were alive, but death has them at last."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p>The Count's eyes grew suddenly cold and hard, so that Vjera shuddered as
she caught the look of hatred in them.</p>

<p>"Death, death, death!" he cried. "Death the judge, the gaoler, the
executioner! He has done justice on them for me, and they will not break
loose from the house he has made for them to lie in and to sleep in for
ever. And now, friend Death, I am master in their stead, and you must
give me time to enjoy the mastership before you serve me likewise. Oh
Vjera, the joy, the delight, the ecstasy, the glory of it all!"</p>

<p>He struck the palms of his lean hands together with the gesture of a
boy, and laughed aloud in the sheer overflowing of his heart. But Vjera
sat still, silent and thoughtful, beside him, watching him rather
anxiously as though she feared lest the excess of his happiness might do
him an injury.</p>

<p>"You do not say anything, Vjera. You do not seem glad," he said,
suddenly noticing her expression.</p>

<p>"I am very glad, indeed I am," she answered, smiling with a great
effort. "Who would not be glad at the thought of seeing you enjoy your
own again?"</p>

<p>"It is not for the money, Vjera!" he exclaimed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span> in a lower and more
concentrated tone. "It is not really for the money nor for the lands,
nor even for the position or the dignity. Do you know what it is that
makes me so happy? I have got the best of it. That is it. It has been a
long struggle and a weary one, but I knew I should win, though I never
saw how it was to be. When they turned me away from them like a dog, my
father and my brother, I faced them on the threshold for the last time
and I said to them, 'Look you, you have made an outcast of me, and yet I
am your son, my father, and your brother, my brother, and you know it.
And yet I tell you that when we meet again, I shall be master here, and
not you.' And so it has turned out, Vjera, for they shall meet me&mdash;they
dead, and I alive. They jeered and laughed, and sent me away with only
the clothes I wore, for I would not take their money. I hear their
laughter now in my ears&mdash;but I hear, too, a laugh that is louder and
more pitiless than theirs was, for it is the laugh of Death!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>
</div>

<p>The Count rose to his feet as he finished the last sentence. It seemed
as though he were oppressed by the inaction to which he was constrained
during the last hours of waiting before the great moment, and he moved
nervously, like a man anxious to throw off a burden.</p>

<p>Vjera rose also, with a slow and weary movement.</p>

<p>"It is late," she said. "I must go home. Good-night."</p>

<p>"No. I will go with you. I will see you to your door."</p>

<p>"Thank you," she answered, watching his face closely.</p>

<p>Then the two walked side by side under the lime trees in the deepening
evening shadows, to the low archway by which the road leads out of the
Hofgarten on the side of the city. For some minutes neither spoke, but
Vjera could hear her companion's quickly drawn, irregular breath. His
heart was beating fast and his thoughts were chasing each other through
a labyrinth of dreams, inconsequent,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span> unreasonable, but brilliant in the
extreme. His head high, his shoulders thrown back, his eyes flashing,
his lips tightly closed, the Count marched out with his companion into
the broad square. He felt that this had been the last day of his slavery
and that the morrow's sun was to rise upon a brighter and a happier
period of his life, in which there should be no more poverty, no more
manual labour, no more pinching and grinding and tormenting of himself
in the hopeless effort at outward and visible respectability. Poor Vjera
saw in his face what was passing in his mind, but her own expression of
sadness did not change. On the contrary, since his last outbreak of
triumphant satisfaction she had been more than usually depressed. For a
long time the Count did not again notice her low spirits, being absorbed
in the contemplation of his own splendid future. At last he seemed to
recollect her presence at his side, glanced at her, made as though to
say something, checked himself, and began humming snatches from an old
opera. But either his musical memory did not serve him, or his humour
changed all at once, for he suddenly was silent again, and after
glancing once more at Vjera's downcast face his own became very grave.</p>

<p>He had been brought back to present considerations,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span> and he found
himself in one of those dilemmas with which his genuine pride, his
innocent and harmless vanity and his innate kindness constantly beset
his life. He had asked Vjera to marry him, scarcely half an hour
earlier, and he now found himself separated from the moment which had
given birth to the generous impulse, by a lengthened contemplation of
his own immediate return to wealth and importance.</p>

<p>He was deeply attached to the poor Polish girl, as men shipwrecked upon
desert islands grow fond of persons upon whom they could have bestowed
no thought in ordinary life. He had grown well accustomed to his poor
existence, and in the surroundings in which he found himself, Vjera was
the one being in whom, besides sympathy for his misfortune, he
discovered a sensibility rarer than common, and the unconscious
development of a natural refinement. There are strange elements to be
found in all great cities among the colonies of strangers who make their
dwellings therein. Brought together by trouble, they live in tolerance
among themselves, and none asks the other the fundamental question of
upper society, "Whence art thou?"&mdash;nor does any make of his neighbour
the inquiry which rises first to the lips of the man of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span> action,
"Whither goest thou?" They meet as the seaweed meets on the crest of the
wave, of many colours from many distant depths, to intermingle for a
time in the motion of the waters, to part company under the driving of
the north wind, to be drifted at last, forgetful of each other, by tides
and currents which wash the opposite ends of the earth. This is the life
of the emigrant, of the exile, of the wanderer among men; the
incongruous elements meet, have brief acquaintance and part, not to meet
again. Who shall count the faces that the exile has known, the voices
that have been familiar in his ear, the hands that have pressed his? In
every land and in every city, he has met and talked with a score, with
scores, with hundreds of men and women all leading the more or less
mysterious and uncertain life which has become his own by necessity or
by choice. If he be an honest man and poor, a dozen trades have occupied
his fingers in half a dozen capitals; if he be dishonest, a hundred
forms and varieties of money-bringing dishonesty are sheathed like
arrows in his quiver, to be shot unawares into the crowd of well-to-do
and unsuspecting citizens on the borders of whose respectable society
the adventurer warily picks his path.</p>

<p>It is rarely that two persons meet under such<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span> circumstances between
whom the bond of a real sympathy exists and can develop into lasting
friendship between man and man, or into true love between man and woman.
When both feel themselves approaching such a point, they are also
unconsciously returning to civilisation, and with the civilising
influence arises the desire to ask the fatal question, "Whence art
thou?"&mdash;or the fear lest the other may ask it, and the anxiety to find
an answer where there is none that will bear scrutiny.</p>

<p>It was therefore natural that the Count should feel disturbed at what he
had done, in spite of his sincere and honourable wish to abide by his
proposal and to make Vjera his wife. He felt that in returning to his
own position in the world he owed it in a measure to himself to wed with
a maiden of whom he could at least say that she came of honest people.
Always centred in his own alternating hopes and fears, and conscious of
little in the lives of others, it seemed to him that a great difficulty
had suddenly revealed itself to his apprehensions. At the same time, by
a self-contradiction familiar to such natures as his, he felt himself
more and more strongly drawn to the girl, and more and more strictly
bound in honour to marry her. As he thought of this, his habitual
contempt of the world<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span> and its opinion returned. What had the world done
for him? And if he had felt no obligation to consult it in his poverty,
why need he bend to any such slavery in the coming days of his
splendour? He stopped suddenly at the corner of the street in which the
Polish girl lived. She lodged, with a little sister who was still too
young to work, in a room she hired of a respectable Bohemian shoemaker.
The latter's wife was of the sour-good kind, whose chief talent lies in
giving their kind actions a hard-hearted appearance.</p>

<p>"Vjera," said the Count, earnestly, "I have been talking a great deal
about myself. You must forgive me, for the news I have received is so
very important and makes such a sudden difference in my prospects. But
you have not given me the answer I want to my question. Will you be my
wife, Vjera, and come with me out of this wretched existence to share my
happy life and to make it happier? Will you?"</p>

<p>His tone was so sincere and loving that it produced a little storm of
evanescent happiness in the girl's heart, and the tears started to her
eyes and stained her sallow, waxen cheeks.</p>

<p>"Ah, if it could only be true!" she exclaimed in a voice more than half
full of hope, as she quickly brushed away the drops.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<p>"But it is true, indeed it is," answered the Count. "Oh, Vjera, do you
think I would deceive you? Do you think I could tell you a story in
which there is no truth whatever? Do not think that of me, Vjera."</p>

<p>The tears broke out afresh, but from a different source. For some
seconds she could not speak.</p>

<p>"Why do you cry so bitterly?" he asked, not understanding at all what
was passing. "I swear to you it is all true&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is not that&mdash;it is not that," cried Vjera. "I know&mdash;I know that you
believe it&mdash;and I love you so very much&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But then, I do not understand," said the Count in a low voice that
expressed his pitiful perplexity. "How can I not believe it, when it is
all in the letters? And why should you not believe it, too? Besides,
Vjera dear, it will all be quite clear to-morrow. Of course&mdash;well, I can
understand that having known me poor so long, it must seem strange to
you to think of me as very rich. But I shall not be another man, for
that. I shall always be the same for you, Vjera, always the same."</p>

<p>"Yes, always the same," sighed the girl under her breath.</p>

<p>"Yes, and so, if you love me to-day, you will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span> love me just as well
to-morrow&mdash;to-morrow, the great day for me. What day will it be? Let me
see&mdash;to-morrow is Wednesday."</p>

<p>"Wednesday, yes," repeated Vjera. "If only there were no to-morrow&mdash;"
She checked herself. "I mean," she added, quickly, "if only it could be
Thursday, without any day between."</p>

<p>"You are a strange girl, Vjera. I do not know what you are thinking of
to-day. But to-morrow you will see. I think they will come for me in the
morning. You shall see, you shall see."</p>

<p>Vjera began to move onward and the Count walked by her side, wondering
at her manner and tormenting his brain in the vain effort to understand
it. In front of her door he held out his hand.</p>

<p>"Promise me one thing," he said, as she laid her fingers in his and
looked up at him. Her eyes were still full of tears.</p>

<p>"What is it?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Promise that you will be my wife, when you are convinced that all this
good fortune is real. You do not believe in it, though I cannot tell
why. I only ask that when you are obliged to believe in it, you will do
as I ask."</p>

<p>Vjera hesitated, and as she stood still the hand he held trembled
nervously.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<p>"I promise," she said, at last, as though with a great effort. Then, all
at once, she covered her eyes and leaned against the door-post. He laid
his hand caressingly upon her shoulder.</p>

<p>"Is it so hard to say?" he asked, tenderly.</p>

<p>"Oh, but if it should ever be indeed true!" she moaned. "If it
should&mdash;if it should!"</p>

<p>"What then? Shall we not be happy together? Will it not be even pleasant
to remember these wretched years?"</p>

<p>"But if it should turn out so&mdash;oh, how can I ever be a fitting wife for
you, how can I learn all that a great lady must think, and do, and say?
I shall be unworthy of you&mdash;of your new friends, of your new world&mdash;but
then, it cannot really happen. No&mdash;do not speak of it any more, it hurts
me too much&mdash;good-night, good-night! Let us sleep and forget, and go
back to our work in the morning, as though nothing had happened&mdash;in the
morning, to-morrow. Will you? Then good-night."</p>

<p>"There will be no work to-morrow," he said, returning to his argument.
But she broke away and fled from him and disappeared in the dark and
narrow staircase. As he stood, he could hear her light tread on the
creaking wood of the steps, fainter and fainter in the distance. Then he
caught<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span> the feeble tinkle of a little bell, the opening and shutting of
a door, and he was alone in the gloom of the evening.</p>

<p>For some minutes he stood still, as though listening for some faint echo
from the direction in which Vjera had disappeared, then he slowly and
thoughtfully walked away. He had forgotten to eat at dinner-time, and
now he forgot that the hour of the second meal had come round. He walked
on, not knowing and not caring whither he went, absorbed in the
contemplation of the bright pictures which framed themselves in his
brain, troubled only by his ever-recurring wonder at Vjera's behaviour.</p>

<p>Unconsciously, and from sheer force of habit, he threaded the streets in
the direction of the tobacconist's shop where so much of his time was
spent. If it be not true that the ghosts of the dead haunt places
familiar to them in life, yet the superstition is founded upon the
instincts of human nature. Men begin to haunt certain spots
unconsciously while they are alive, especially those which they are
obliged to visit every day and in which they are accustomed to sit, idle
or at work, during the greater part of the week. The artist, when he
wishes to be completely at rest, re-enters the studio he left but an
hour earlier; the sailor hangs about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span> the port when he is ashore, the
shopman cannot resist the temptation to spend an hour among his wares on
Sunday, the farmer is irresistibly drawn to the field to while away the
time on holidays between dinner and supper. We all of us see more and
understand better what we see, in those surroundings most familiar to
us, and it is a general law that the average intelligence likes the best
that which it understands with the least effort. The mechanical part of
us, too, when free from any direct and especial impulse of the mind,
does unknowingly what it has been in the habit of doing. Two-thirds of
all the physical diseases in the world are caused by the disturbance of
the mental habits and are vastly aggravated by the direction of the
thoughts to the part afflicted. Idiots and madmen are often phenomenally
healthy people, because there is in their case no unnatural effort of
the mind to control and manage the body. The Count having bestowed no
thought upon the direction of his walk, mechanically turned towards the
scene of his daily labour.</p>

<p>Considering that he believed himself to have abandoned for ever the
irksome employment of rolling tobacco in a piece of parchment in order
to slip it into a piece of paper, it might have been supposed that he
would be glad to look at anything<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span> rather than the glass door of the
shop in which he had repeated that operation so many hundreds of
thousands of times; or, at least, it might have been expected that on
realising where he was he would be satisfied with a glance of
recognition and would turn away.</p>

<p>But the Count's fate had ordained otherwise. When he reached the shop
the lights were burning brightly in the show window and within. Through
the glass door he could see that Fischelowitz was comfortably installed
in a chair behind the counter, contentedly smoking one of his own best
cigarettes, and smiling happily to himself through the fragrant cloud.
If the tobacconist's wife had been present, the Count would have gone
away without entering, for he did not like her, and had reason to
suspect that she hated him, which was indeed the case. But Akulina was
nowhere to be seen, the shop looked bright and cheerful, the Count was
tired, he pushed the door and entered. Fischelowitz turned his head
without modifying his smile, and seeing who his visitor was nodded
familiarly. The Count raised his hat a little from his head and
immediately replaced it.</p>

<p>"Good-evening, Herr Fischelowitz," he said, speaking, as usual, in
German.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

<p>"Good-evening, Count," answered the tobacconist, cheerfully. "Sit down,
and light a cigarette. What is the news?"</p>

<p>"Great news with me, for to-morrow," said the other, bending his head as
he stooped over the nickel-plated lamp on the counter, in which a tiny
flame burned for the convenience of customers. "To-morrow, at this time,
I shall be on my way to Petersburg."</p>

<p>"Well, I hope so, for your sake," was the good-humoured reply. "But I am
afraid it will always be to-morrow, Herr Graf."</p>

<p>The Count shook his head after staring for a few seconds at his
employer, and then smoked quietly, as though he attached no weight to
the remark. Fischelowitz looked curiously at him, and during a brief
moment the smile faded from his face.</p>

<p>"You have not been long at supper," he remarked, after a pause. The
observation was suggested by the condition of his own appetite.</p>

<p>"Supper?" repeated the Count, rather vaguely. "I believe I had forgotten
all about it. I will go presently."</p>

<p>"The Count is reserving himself for to-morrow," said an ironical voice
in the background. Akulina entered the shop from the workroom, a
guttering<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span> candle in a battered candlestick in one hand, and a number of
gaily coloured pasteboard boxes tucked under the other arm. "What is the
use of eating to-day when there will be so many good things to-morrow?"</p>

<p>Neither Fischelowitz nor the Count vouchsafed any answer to this thrust.
For the second time, since the Count had entered, however, the
tobacconist wore an expression approaching to gravity. The Count himself
kept his composure admirably, only glancing coldly at Akulina, and then
looking at his cigarette. Akulina is a broad, fat woman, with a
flattened Tartar face, small eyes, good but short teeth, full lips and a
dark complexion. She reminds one of an over-fed tabby cat, of doubtful
temper, and her voice seems to reach utterance after traversing some
thick, soft medium, which lends it an odd sort of guttural richness. She
moves quietly but heavily and has an Asiatic second sight in the matter
of finance. In matters of thrift and foresight her husband places
implicit confidence in her judgment. In matters of generosity and
kindness implying the use of money, he never consults her.</p>

<p>"It is amazing to see how much people will believe," she said, putting
out her candle and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span> snuffing it with her thumb and forefinger. Then she
began to arrange the boxes she had brought, setting them in order upon
the shelves. Still neither of the men answered her. But she was not the
woman to be reduced to silence by silence.</p>

<p>"I am always telling you that it is all rubbish," she continued, turning
a broad expanse of alpaca-covered back upon her audience. "I am always
telling you that you are no more a count than Fischelowitz is a grand
duke, that the whole thing is a foolish imagination which you have stuck
into your head, as one sticks tobacco into a paper shell. And it ought
to be burned out of your head, or starved out, or knocked out, or
something, for if it stays there it will addle your brains altogether.
Why cannot you see that you are in the world just like other people, and
give up all these ridiculous dreams and all this chatter about counts
and princes and such like people, of whom you never spoke to one in your
life, for all you may say?"</p>

<p>The Count glanced at the back of Akulina's head, which was decently
covered by a flattened twist of very shining black hair, and then he
looked at Fischelowitz as though to inquire whether the latter would
suffer a gentleman to be thus insulted in his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span> presence and on his
premises. Fischelowitz seemed embarrassed, and coloured a little.</p>

<p>"You might choose your language a little more carefully, wife," he
observed in a rather timid tone.</p>

<p>"And you might choose your friends with a better view to your own
interests," she answered without hesitation. "If you allow this sort of
thing to go on, and four children growing up, and you expecting to open
another shop this summer&mdash;why, you had better turn count yourself," she
concluded, triumphantly, and with that nice logical perception peculiar
to her kind.</p>

<p>"If you mean to say that the Count's valuable help has not been to our
advantage&mdash;" began Fischelowitz, making a desperate effort to give a
more pleasant look to things.</p>

<p>"Oh, I know that," laughed Akulina, scornfully. "I know that the Count,
as you call him, can make his two thousand a day as well as any one. I
am not blind. And I know you, and I know that it is a sort of foolish
pleasure to you to employ a count in the work and to pay your money to a
count, though he does not earn it any better than any one else, nor any
worse, to be just. And I know the Count, and I know his friends who
borrow fifty marks of you and pay you back in stuffed dolls with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span> tunes
in them. I know you, Christian Gregorovitch"&mdash;at the thought of the lost
money Akulina broke at last into her native language and gave the reins
to her fury in good Russian&mdash;"yes, I know you, and him, and his friends
and your friends, and I see the good yellow money flying out of the
window like a flight of canary birds when the cage is opened, and I see
you grinning like Player-Ape over the vile Vienna puppet, and winding up
its abominable music as though you were turning the key upon your money
in the safe instead of listening to the tune of its departure. And then
because Akulina has the courage to tell you the truth, and to tell you
that your fine Count is no count, and that his friends get from you ten
times the money he earns, then you turn on me like a bear, ready to bite
off my head, and you tell me to choose my language! Is there no shame in
you, Christian Gregorovitch, or is there also no understanding? Am I the
mother of your four children or not? I would like to ask. I suppose you
cannot deny that, whatever else you deny which is true, and you tell me
to choose my language! <i>Da</i>, I will choose my language, in truth! <i>Da</i>,
I will choose out such a swarm of words as ought to sting your ears like
hornets, if you had not such a leathery skin and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span> such a soft brain
inside it. But why should I? It is thrown away. There is no shame in
you. You see nothing, you care for nothing, you hear no reason, you feel
no argument. I will go home and make soup. I am better there than in the
shop. Oh yes! it is always that. Akulina can make good things to eat,
and good tea and good punch to drink, and Akulina is the Archangel
Michael in the kitchen. But if Akulina says to you, 'Save a penny here,
do not lend more than you have there,' Akulina is a fool and must be
told to choose her language, lest it be too indelicate for the dandified
ears of the high-born gentleman! I should not wonder if, by choosing her
language carefully enough, Akulina ended by making the high-born
gentleman understand something after all. His perception cannot possibly
be so dull as yours, Christian Gregorovitch, my little husband."</p>

<p>Akulina paused for breath after her tremendous invective, which, indeed,
was only intended by her for the preface of the real discourse, so
fertile was her imagination and so thoroughly roused was her eloquence
by the sense of injury received. While she was speaking, Fischelowitz,
whose terror of his larger half was only relative, had calmly risen and
had wound up the "Wiener Gigerl" to the extreme<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span> of the doll's powers,
placing it on the counter before him and sitting down before it in
anticipation of the amusement he expected to derive from its
performance. In the short silence which ensued while Akulina was resting
her lungs for a second and more deadly effort, the wretched little
musical box made itself heard, clicking and scratching and grinding out
a miserable little polka. At the sound, the sunny smile returned to the
tobacconist's face. He knew that no earthly eloquence, no scathing wit,
no brutal reply could possibly exasperate his wife as this must. He
resented everything she had said, and in his vulgar way he was ashamed
that she should have said it before the Count, and now he was glad that
by the mere turning of a key he could answer her storm of words in a way
to drive her to fury, while at the same time showing his own
indifference. As for the Count himself, he had moved nearer to the door
and was looking quietly out into the irregularly lighted street, smoking
as though he had not heard a word of what had been said. As he stood, it
was impossible for either of the others to see his face, and he betrayed
no agitation by movement or gesture.</p>

<p>Akulina turned pale to the lips, as her husband had anticipated. It is
probable that the most tragic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span> event conceivable in her existence could
not have affected her more powerfully than the twang of the musical box
and the twisting and turning of the insolent little wooden head. She
came round to the front of the counter with gleaming eyes and clenched
fists.</p>

<p>"Stop that thing!" she cried, "Stop it, or it will drive me mad."</p>

<p>Fischelowitz still smiled, and the doll continued to turn round and
round to the tune, while the Count looked out through the open door.
Suddenly there was a quick shadow on the brightly lighted floor of the
shop, followed instantly by a crash, and then with a miserable attempt
to finish its tune the little instrument gave a resounding groan and was
silent. Akulina had struck the Gigerl such a blow as had sent it flying,
pedestal and all, past her husband's head into a dark corner behind the
counter. Fischelowitz reddened with anger, and Akulina stood ready to
take to flight, glad that the broad counter was between herself and her
husband. Her fury had spent itself in one blow and she would have given
anything to set the doll up in its place again unharmed. She realised at
the same instant that she had probably destroyed any intrinsic value
which the thing had possessed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span> and her face fell wofully. The Count
turned slowly where he stood and looked at the couple.</p>

<p>"Are you going to fight each other?" he inquired in unusually bland
tones.</p>

<p>At the sound of his voice the Russian woman's anger rose again, glad to
find some new object upon which to expend itself and on which to
exercise vengeance for the catastrophe its last expression had brought
about. She turned savagely upon the Count and shook her plump brown
fists in his face.</p>

<p>"It is all your fault!" she exclaimed. "What business have you to come
between husband and wife with your friends and your cursed dolls, the
fiend take them, and you! Is it for this that Christian Gregorovitch and
I have lived together in harmony these ten years and more? Is it for
this that we have lived without a word of anger&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What did you say?" asked Fischelowitz, with an angry laugh. But she did
not heed him.</p>

<p>"Without a word of anger between us, these many years?" she continued.
"Is it for this? To have our peace destroyed by a couple of Wiener
Gigerls, a doll and a sham count? But it is over now! It is over, I tell
you&mdash;go, get yourself out of the shop, out of my sight, into the street
where you belong! For honest folks to be harbouring such<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span> a fellow as
you are, and not you only, but your friends and your rag and your tag!
Fie! If you stay here long we shall end in dust and feathers! But you
shall not stay here, whatever that soft-brained husband of mine says.
You shall go and never come back. Do you think that in all Munich there
is no one else who will do the work for three marks a thousand? Bah!
there are scores, and honest people, too, who call themselves by plain
names and speak plainly! None of your counts and your grand dukes and
your Lord-knows-whats! Go, you adventurer, you disturber of&mdash;why do you
look at me like that? I have always known the truth about you, and I
have never been able to bear the sight of you and never shall. You have
deceived my husband, poor man, because he is not as clever as he is
good-natured, but you never could deceive me, try as you would, and the
Lord knows, you have tried often enough. Pah! You good-for-nothing!"</p>

<p>The poor Count had drawn back against the well-filled shop and had
turned deadly pale as she heaped insult upon insult upon him in her
incoherent and foul-mouthed anger. As soon as she paused, exhausted by
the effort to find epithets to suit her hatred of him, he went up to the
counter where<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span> Fischelowitz was sitting, very much disturbed at the
course events were taking.</p>

<p>"My dear Count," began the latter, anxious to set matters right, "pray
do not pay any attention&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I think I had better say good-bye," answered the Count in a low tone.
"We part on good terms, though you might have said a word for me just
now."</p>

<p>"He dare not!" cried Akulina.</p>

<p>"And as for the doll, if you will give it to me, I promise you that you
shall have your fifty marks to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Oho! He knows where to get fifty marks, now!" exclaimed Akulina,
viciously.</p>

<p>Fischelowitz picked up the puppet, which was broken in two in the waist,
so that the upper half of the body hung down by the legs, in a limp
fashion, held only by the little red coat. The tobacconist wrapped it up
in a piece of newspaper without a word and handed it to the Count. He
felt perhaps that the only atonement he could offer for his wife's
brutal conduct was to accede to the request.</p>

<p>"Thank you," said the Count, taking the thing. "On the word of a
gentleman you shall have the money before to-morrow night."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>

<p>"A good riddance of both of them," snarled Akulina, as the Count lifted
his hat and then, his head bent more than was his wont, passed out of
the shop with the remains of the poor Gigerl under his arm.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>
</div>

<p>The Count had no precise object in view when he hurriedly left the shop
with the parcel containing the broken doll. What he most desired for the
moment was to withdraw himself from the storm of Akulina's abuse, seeing
that he had no means of checking the torrent, nor of exacting
satisfaction for the insults received. However he might have acted had
the aggressor been a man, he was powerless when attacked by a woman, and
he was aware that he had followed the only course which had in it
anything of dignity and self-respect. To stand and bandy words and
epithets of abuse would have been worse than useless, to treat the
tobacconist like a gentleman and to hold him responsible for his wife's
language would have been more than absurd. So the Count took the remains
of the puppet and went on his way.</p>

<p>He was not, however, so superior to good and bad treatment as not to
feel deeply wounded and thoroughly roused to anger. Perhaps, if he had
been already in possession of the fortune and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span> dignity which he expected
on the morrow, he might have smiled contemptuously at the virago's noisy
wrath, feeling nothing and caring even less what she felt towards him.
But he had too long been poor and wretched to bear with equanimity any
reference to his wretchedness or his poverty, and he was too painfully
conscious of the weight of outward circumstances in determining men's
judgments of their fellows not to be stung by the words that had been so
angrily applied to him. Moreover, and worst of all, there was the fact
that Fischelowitz had really lent the money to a poor countryman who had
previously made the acquaintance of the Count, and had by that means
induced the tobacconist to help him. It was true, indeed, that the poor
Count had himself lent the fellow all he had in his pocket, which meant
all that he had in the world, and had been half starved in consequence
during a whole week. The man was an idle vagabond of the worst type,
with a pitiful tale of woe well worded and logically put together, out
of which he made a good livelihood. Nature, as though to favour his
designs, had given him a face which excited sympathy, and he had the wit
to cover his eyes, his own tell-tale feature, with coloured glasses. He
had cheated several scores<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span> of persons in the Slav colony of Munich, and
had then gone in search of other pastures. How he had obtained
possession of the Wiener Gigerl was a mystery as yet unsolved. It had
certainly seemed odd in the tobacconist's opinion that a man of such
outward appearance should have received such an extremely improbable
Christmas present, for such the adventurer declared the doll to be, from
a rich aunt in Warsaw, who refused to give him a penny of ready money
and had caused him to be turned from her doors by her servants when he
had last visited her, on the ground that he had joined the Russian
Orthodox Church without her consent. The facetious young villain had
indeed declared that she had sent him the puppet as a piece of scathing
irony, illustrative of his character as she conceived it. But though
such an illustration would have been apt beyond question, yet it seemed
improbable that the aunt would have chosen such a means of impressing it
upon her nephew's mind. Fischelowitz, however, asked no questions, and
took the Gigerl as payment of the debt. The thing amused him, and it
diverted him to construct an imaginary chain of circumstances to explain
how the man in the coloured glasses had got possession of it. It was of
course wholly inconceivable that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span> even the most accomplished shop-lifter
should have carried off an object of such inconvenient proportions from
the midst of its fellows and under the very eyes of the vendor. If he
had supposed a theft possible, Fischelowitz would never have allowed the
doll to remain on his premises a single day. He was too kind-hearted,
also, to blame the Count, as his wife did, for having been the promoter
of the loan, for he readily admitted that he would have lent as much,
had he made the vagabond's acquaintance under any other circumstances.</p>

<p>But the Count, since Akulina had expressed herself with so much force
and precision, could not look upon the affair in the same light. However
Fischelowitz regarded it, Akulina had made it clear that the Count ought
to be held responsible for the loss, and it was not in the nature of
such a man, no matter how wretched his own estate, to submit to the
imputation of being concerned in borrowing money which was never to be
repaid. His natural impulse had been to promise repayment instantly, and
as he was expecting to be turned into a rich man on the morrow the
engagement seemed an easy one to keep. It would be more difficult to
explain why he wanted to take away the broken puppet with him. Possibly
he felt that in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span> removing it from the shop, he was taking with it even
the memory of the transaction of which the blame had been so bitterly
thrown on him; or, possibly, he was really attached to the toy for its
associations, or, lastly, he may have felt impelled to save it from
Akulina's destroying wrath, so far as it yet could be said to be saved.</p>

<p>As has been said, he had not dined on that day, and he would very
probably have forgotten to eat, even after being reminded of the meal by
the tobacconist, had he not passed, on his way homeward, the obscure
restaurant in which he and the other men who worked for Fischelowitz
were accustomed to get their food and drink. This fifth-rate
eating-house rejoiced in the attractive name of the "Green Wreath," a
designation painted in large dusty green Gothic letters upon the grey
walls of the dilapidated house in which it was situated. There are not
to be found in respectable Munich those dens of filth and drunkenness
which belong to greater cities whose vices are in proportion greater
also. In Munich the strength of fiery spirits is drowned in oceans of
mild beer, a liquid of which the head will stand more than the waistband
and which, instead of exciting to crime, predisposes the consumer to
peaceful and lengthened<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span> sleep. The worst that can be said of the poorer
public-houses in Munich, is that they are frequented by the poorer
people, and that as the customers bring less money than elsewhere, there
is less drinking in proportion, and a greater demand for large
quantities of very filling food at very low rates. As a general rule,
such places are clean and decently kept, and the sight of a drunken man
in the public room would excite very considerable astonishment, besides
entailing upon the culprit a summary expulsion into the street and a
rather forcible injunction not to repeat the offence.</p>

<p>The four windows of the establishment which opened upon the narrow
street were open, for the weather had become sultry even out of doors,
and the guests wanted fresh air. At one of these windows the Count saw
the heads of Dumnoff and Schmidt. With the instinct of the poor man, the
Count felt in his pocket to see whether he had any money, and was
somewhat disturbed to find but a solitary piece of silver, feebly
supported on either side by a couple of one-penny pieces. He had
forgotten that he had refused to accept his pay for the day's work, and
it required an effort of memory to account for the low state of his
funds. But what he had with him was sufficient for his wants, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
settling his parcel under his arm he ascended the three or four steps
which gave access to the inn, and entered the public room. Besides the
Russian and the Cossack, there were three public porters seated at the
next table, dressed in their blue blouses, their red cloth caps hanging
on the pegs over their heads, all silent and similarly engaged. Each had
before him a piece of that national cheese of which the smell may almost
be heard, each had lately received a thick, irregularly-shaped hunch of
dark bread, and they had one pot of beer and one salt-cellar amongst
them. They all had honest German faces, honest blue eyes, horny hands
and round shoulders. Another table, in a far corner, was occupied by a
poorly-dressed old woman in black, dusty and evidently tired. A covered
basket stood on a chair at her elbow, she was eating an
unwholesome-looking "kn&ouml;del" or boiled potato ball, and half a pint of
beer stood before her still untouched. As for the Cossack and Dumnoff,
they had finished their meal. The former was smoking a cigarette through
a mouth-piece made by boring out the well-dried leg-bone of a chicken
and was drinking nothing. Dumnoff had before him a small glass of the
common whisky known as "corn-brandy" and was trying to give it a flavour
resembling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span> the vodka of his native land by stirring pepper into it with
the blade of an old pocket-knife. Both looked up, without betraying any
surprise, as the Count entered and sat himself down at the end of their
oblong table, facing the open window and with his back to the room. A
word of greeting passed on each side and the two relapsed into silence,
while the Count ordered a sausage "with horse-radish" of the sour-sweet
maiden of five-and-thirty who waited on the guests. The Cossack, always
observant of such things, looked at the oddly-shaped package which the
Count had brought with him, trying to divine its contents and signally
failing in the attempt. Dumnoff, who did not like the Count's
gentlemanlike manners and fine speech, sullenly stirred the fiery
mixture he was concocting. The colour on his prominent cheek-bones was a
little brighter than before supper, but otherwise it was impossible to
say that he was the worse for the half-pint of spirits he had certainly
absorbed since leaving his work. The man's strong peasant nature was
proof against far greater excesses than his purse could afford.</p>

<p>"What is the news?" inquired Johann Schmidt, still eyeing the bundle
curiously, and doubtless hoping that the Count would soon inform him of
the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span> contents. But the latter saw the look and glanced suspiciously at
the questioner.</p>

<p>"No news, that I know of," he answered. "Except for me," he added, after
a pause, and looking dreamily out of the window at a street lamp that
was burning opposite. "To-morrow, at this time, I shall be off."</p>

<p>"And where are you going?" asked the Cossack, good-humouredly. "Are you
going for long, if I may ask?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;yes. I shall never come back to Munich." He had been speaking in
German, but noticing that the other guests in the room were silent, and
thinking that they might listen, he broke off into Russian. "I shall go
home, at last," he said, his face brightening perceptibly as his visions
of wealth again rose before his eyes. "I shall go home and rest myself
for a long time in the country, and then, next winter, perhaps, I will
go to Petersburg."</p>

<p>"Well, well, I wish you a pleasant journey," said Schmidt. "So there is
to be no mistake about the fortune this time?"</p>

<p>"This time?" repeated the Count, as though not understanding. "Why do
you say this time?"</p>

<p>"Because you have so often expected it before," returned the Cossack
bluntly, but without malice.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p>"I do not remember ever saying so," said the other, evidently searching
among his recollections.</p>

<p>"Every Tuesday," growled Dumnoff, sipping his peppery liquor. "Every
Tuesday since I can remember."</p>

<p>"I think you must be mistaken," said the Count, politely.</p>

<p>Dumnoff grunted something quite incomprehensible, and which might have
been taken for the clearing of his huge throat after the inflaming
draught. The Cossack was silent, and his bright eyes looked pityingly at
his companion.</p>

<p>"And you have begun to put together your parcels for the journey, I
see," he observed after a time, when the Count had got his morsel of
food and was beginning to eat it. His curiosity gave him no rest.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered the Count, mysteriously. "That is something which I
shall probably take with me, as a remembrance of Munich."</p>

<p>"I should not have thought that you needed anything more than a
cigarette to remind you of the place," remarked Dumnoff.</p>

<p>The Count smiled faintly, for, considering Dumnoff's natural dulness,
the remark had a savour of wit in it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>

<p>"That is true," he said. "But there are other things which could remind
me even more forcibly of my exile."</p>

<p>"Well, what is it? Tell us!" cried Dumnoff, impatiently enough, but
somewhat softened by the Count's appreciation of his humour. At the same
time he put out his broad red hand in the direction of the parcel as
though he would see for himself.</p>

<p>"Let it be!" said Schmidt sharply, and Dumnoff withdrew his hand again.
He had fallen into the habit of always doing what the Cossack told him
to do, obeying mutely, like a well-trained dog, though he obeyed no one
else. The descendant of freemen instinctively lorded it over the
descendant of the serf, and the latter as instinctively submitted.</p>

<p>The Count's temper, however, was singularly changeable on this day, for
he did not seem to resent Dumnoff's meditated attack upon the package,
as he would certainly have done under ordinary circumstances.</p>

<p>"If you are so very curious to know what it is, I will tell you," he
said. "You know the Wiener Gigerl?"</p>

<p>"Of course," answered both men together.</p>

<p>"Well, that is it, in that parcel."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<p>"The Gigerl!" exclaimed the Cossack. Dumnoff only opened his small eyes
in stupid amazement. Both knew something of the circumstances under
which Fischelowitz had come into possession of the doll, and both knew
what store the tobacconist set by it.</p>

<p>"Then you have paid the fifty marks?" asked Schmidt, whose curiosity was
roused instead of satisfied.</p>

<p>"No. I shall pay the money to-morrow. I have promised to do so. As it
chances, it will be convenient." The Count smiled to himself in a
meaning way, as though already enjoying the triumph of laying the gold
pieces upon the counter under Akulina's flat nose.</p>

<p>"And yet Fischelowitz has already given it to you! He must be very sure
of you&mdash;" With his usual lack of tact, Schmidt had gone further than he
meant to do, but the transaction savoured of the marvellous.</p>

<p>"To be strictly truthful," said the Count, who had a Quixotic fear of
misleading in the smallest degree any one to whom he was speaking, "to
be exactly honest, there is a circumstance which makes it less
remarkable that Fischelowitz should have given me the doll at once."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<p>"Of course, of course!" exclaimed the Cossack, anxious to appear
credulous out of kindness. "Fischelowitz knows as well as you do
yourself how safe you are to get the money to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Naturally," replied the Count, with great calmness. "But besides that,
the Gigerl is broken&mdash;badly broken in the middle, and the musical box is
spoiled too."</p>

<p>"Fischelowitz must have been very angry," observed Dumnoff.</p>

<p>"Not at all. It was his wife. Akulina knocked it from the counter into
the farthest corner of the shop."</p>

<p>"Tell us all about it," said Schmidt, more interested than ever.</p>

<p>"Ah, that&mdash;that is quite another matter," answered the Count, reddening
perceptibly as he remembered Akulina's furious abuse.</p>

<p>"If you do not, I have no doubt that she will," said Dumnoff, taking
another sip. "She always gives the news of you, before you come in the
morning, before we have made our first hundred."</p>

<p>The Count grew redder still, the angry colour mantling in his lean
cheeks. He hesitated a moment, and then made up his mind.</p>

<p>"If that is likely to happen," he cried, "I had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span> better tell you the
truth myself, instead of giving her an opportunity of distorting it."</p>

<p>"Much better," said the Cossack, eagerly. "One can believe you better
than her."</p>

<p>"That is true, at all events," chimed in Dumnoff, who was only brutal
and never malicious.</p>

<p>"Well, it happened in this way. Fischelowitz and I were talking of
to-morrow, I think, when she came in from the back shop, having
overheard something we had been saying. Of course she immediately took
advantage of my presence to exercise her wit upon me, a proceeding to
which I have grown accustomed, seeing that she is only a woman. Then
Fischelowitz told her to choose her language, and that started her
afresh. It was rather a fine specimen of chosen language that she gave
us, for she has a good command of our beautiful mother-tongue. She found
very strong words, and she said among other things that it was my fault
that her husband had got a Wiener Gigerl for fifty marks of good money.
And then Fischelowitz, in his easy way and while she was talking, wound
the doll up and set it before him on the counter and smiled at it. But
she went on, worse than before, and called me everything under the sun.
Of course I could do nothing but wait until she had finished, for I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
could not beat her, and I would not let her think that she could drive
me away by mere talk, bad as it was."</p>

<p>"What did she call you?" asked Dumnoff, with a grin.</p>

<p>"She called me a good-for-nothing," said the Count, reddening with anger
again, so that the veins stood out on his throat above his collar. "And
she called me, I think, an adventurer."</p>

<p>"Is that all?" laughed Dumnoff. "I have been called by worse names than
that in my time!"</p>

<p>"I have not," answered the Count, with sudden coolness. "However,
between me and Fischelowitz and the Gigerl, she grew so angry that she
struck the only one of us three against whom she dared lift hand. That
member of the company chanced to be the unfortunate doll. And then I
promised that to-morrow I would pay the money, and I made Fischelowitz
give it to me in a piece of newspaper, and there it is."</p>

<p>"What a terrible smash there must have been in the shop!" said Dumnoff.
"I would like to have seen the lady's face."</p>

<p>In their Russian speech, the difference between the original social
standing of the three men who now worked as equals, was well defined by
their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span> way of speaking of Fischelowitz's wife. To Dumnoff, mujik by
origin and by nature, she was "barina," the town "lady," to the Cossack
she was "chosjaika," the "mistress," the wife of the "patron"&mdash;to the
Count she was Akulina, and when he addressed her he called her Akulina
Feodorovna, adding the derivative of her father's name in accordance
with the universal Russian custom.</p>

<p>"Let us see the doll," said Schmidt, still curious. The Count, whose
eating had been interrupted by the telling of his story, pushed the
parcel towards the Cossack with one hand, while using his fork with the
other.</p>

<p>Johann Schmidt carefully unwrapped the newspaper and exposed the
unfortunate Gigerl to view. Then with both hands he set it up before
him, raising the limp figure from the waist, and trying to put it into
position, until it almost recovered something of its old look of
insolence, though the eye-glass was broken and the little white hat
sadly battered. The three men contemplated it in silence, and the other
guests turned curious glances towards it. Dumnoff, as usual, laughed
hoarsely.</p>

<p>"Rather the worse for wear," he observed.</p>

<p>"Kreuzmillionendonnerwetter! That is my Gigerl!" roared a deep German
voice across the room.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>

<p>The three Russians started and looked round quickly. One of the porters,
a burly man with an angry scowl on his honest face, was already on his
legs and was striding towards the table.</p>

<p>"That is my Gigerl!" he repeated, laying one heavy hand upon the board,
and thrusting the forefinger of the other under the doll's nose.</p>

<p>Dumnoff stared at him with an expression which showed that he did not in
the least understand what was happening. Johann Schmidt's keen black
eyes looked wonderingly from the porter to the Count, while the latter
leaned back in his chair, contemplating the angry man with a calm
surprise which proved how little faith he placed in the assertion of
possession.</p>

<p>"You are under a mistake," he said, with great politeness. "This doll is
the property of Herr Fischelowitz, the well-known tobacconist, and has
stood in the window of his shop nearly four months. These gentlemen"&mdash;he
waved his hand towards his two companions&mdash;"are well aware of the fact
and can vouch&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That is all the same to me," interrupted the porter. "This is the
Gigerl which was stolen from me on New Year's eve&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I repeat," said the Count, with dignity, "that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span> you are altogether
mistaken. I will trouble you to leave us in peace and to make no more
disturbance, where you are evidently in error."</p>

<p>His coolness exasperated the porter, who seemed very sure of what he
asserted.</p>

<p>"That is what we shall see," he retorted in a menacing tone. "Meanwhile
it does not occur to me to leave you in peace and to make no more
trouble. I tell you that this Gigerl was stolen from me on New Year's
eve. I know it well enough, for I had to pay for it."</p>

<p>"How can you prove that this is the one?" inquired the Cossack, who was
beginning to lose his temper.</p>

<p>"You have nothing to say about it," said the porter, sharply. "I have to
do with this man"&mdash;he pointed down at the Count&mdash;"who has brought the
doll here, and pretends to know where it comes from."</p>

<p>"Kerl!" exclaimed the Count, angrily. "Fellow! I am not accustomed to
being called 'man,' or to having my word doubted. You had better be
civil."</p>

<p>"Then it is high time that you grew used to it," returned the porter,
growing more and more excited. "The police do not overwhelm fellows of
your kind with politeness."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<p>"Fellows?" cried the Count, losing his self-control altogether at being
called by the name he had just applied to the porter. Without a moment's
hesitation, he sprang from his chair, upsetting it behind him, and took
the burly German by the throat.</p>

<p>"Call a policeman, Anton!" shouted the latter to one of his companions,
as he closed with his antagonist.</p>

<p>The two other porters had risen from their places as soon as the Count
had laid his hands on their friend, and the one who answered to the name
of Anton promptly trotted towards the door, his heavy tread making the
whole room shake as he ran. The other came up quickly and attacked the
Count from behind, when Dumnoff, aroused at last to the pleasant
consciousness that a real fight was going on, brought down his clenched
fist with such earnestness of purpose on the top of the second porter's
crown that the latter reeled backwards and fell across the Count's chair
in an attitude rendered highly uncomfortable by the fact that the said
chair had been turned upside down at the beginning of the contest.
Having satisfied himself that the blow had taken effect, Dumnoff
proceeded to the other side of the field of battle, avoiding the
quickly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span> moving bodies of the Count and the porter as they wrestled with
each other, and the mujik prepared to deal another sledge-hammer blow,
in all respects comparable with the first. A pleasant smile beamed and
spread over his broad, bony face as he lifted his fist, and it is
comparatively certain that he would have put an effectual end to the
struggle, had not Schmidt interfered with the execution of his amiable
intentions by catching his arm in mid-air. Even the Cossack's wiry
strength could not arrest the descent of the tremendous fist, but he
succeeded at least in diverting it from its aim, so that it took effect
in the middle of the porter's back, knocking most of the wind out of the
man's body and causing a diversion favourable to the Count's security.
Schmidt sprang in and separated the combatants.</p>

<p>"There has been enough dancing already," he said, coolly, as he faced
the porter, who was gasping for breath. "But if you have not danced
enough, I shall be happy to take a turn with you round the room."</p>

<p>The poor Count would, indeed, have been no match for his adversary
without the assistance of his friends. He possessed that sort of courage
which, when stung into activity by an insult, takes no account whatever
of the consequences, and his thin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span> frame was animated by very excitable
nerves. But an exceedingly lean diet, and the habit of sitting during
many hours in a close atmosphere, rolling tobacco with his fingers, did
not constitute such a physical training as to make him a match for a
rough fellow whose occupation consisted in tramping long distances and
up and down long flights of stairs from morning till night, loaded with
more or less heavy burdens. He was now very pale and his heart beat
painfully as he endeavoured instinctively to smooth his long frock-coat,
from which a button had been torn out by the roots in a very apparent
place, and to settle his starched collar, which at the best of times
owed its stability to the secret virtues of a pin, and which at present
had made a quarter of a revolution upon itself, so that the
stiffly-starched corners, the Count's chief coquetry and pride, had
established themselves in an unseemly manner immediately below the left
ear.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the little restaurant was in an uproar. The host, a thin,
pale man in an apron and a shabby embroidered cap, had suddenly appeared
from the depths of the taproom, accompanied by his wife, a monstrous,
red-faced creature clothed in a grey flannel frock. The porter whom
Dumnoff had felled, and who was not altogether stunned, was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span> kicking
violently in the attempt to gain his feet among the fallen chairs, a
dozen people had come in from the street at the noise of the fight and
stood near the door, phlegmatically watching the proceedings, and the
poor old woman from the country, who had been supping in the corner, had
got her basket on her knees, holding its handle tightly in one hand and
with the other grasping her half-finished glass of beer, in terror lest
some accident should cause the precious liquid to be spilled, but not
calm enough to put it in a place of safety by the simple process of
swallowing.</p>

<p>"They are foreigners," remarked some one in the crowd at the door.</p>

<p>"They are probably Bohemian journeymen," said a tinman who stood in
front of the others. "It serves them right for interfering with an
honest porter." The Bohemian journeymen are detested in Munich on
account of their willingness to work for low prices, which perhaps
accounted for the tinman's readiness to consider the strangers as
worsted in the contest.</p>

<p>"We Germans fear God, and nothing else in the world," observed a
mealy-faced shoemaker, quoting Prince Bismarck's famous speech.</p>

<p>The man who had wrestled with the Count seemed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span> to have resigned himself
to the course of awaiting the police, and leaned back against the table
behind him, with folded arms, glaring at the Cossack, while the Count
was vainly attempting to recover possession of the pin which had
fastened his collar, and which he evidently suspected of having slipped
down his back, with the total depravity peculiar to all inanimate things
when they are most needed. But the second porter, having broken the
chair, upset a table covered with unused saucers for beer glasses, and
otherwise materially contributing to swell the din and increase the
already considerable havoc, had regained his feet and lost no time in
making for Dumnoff. The Russian, enchanted at the prospect of a renewal
of hostilities so unfortunately interrupted, met the newcomer half-way,
and, each embracing the other with cheerful alacrity, the two heavy men
began to stamp and turn round and round with each other like a couple of
particularly awkward bears attempting to waltz together. They were very
evenly matched for a wrestling bout, for although the German was by a
couple of inches the taller of the two, the Russian had the advantage in
breadth of shoulder and length of arm, as well as in the enormous
strength of his back. The Cossack, having assured himself that there was
to be fair-play,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span> watched the proceedings with evident interest, while
the pale-faced host shambled round and round the room, imploring the
combatants to respect the reputation of his house and to desist, while
keeping himself at a safe distance from possible collision with the
bodies of the two, as they staggered and strained, and reeled and
whirled about.</p>

<p>The Count at last abandoned the search of the lost pin, and having
pulled the front of his collar into a more normal position trusted to
luck to keep it there. The table at which the three had originally sat
had miraculously escaped upsetting, and on it lay the poor Gigerl,
stretched at full length on its back, calm and smiling in the midst of
the noise and confusion, like the corpse at an Irish wake after the
whisky has begun to take effect.</p>

<p>The Count now thought it necessary to justify the unfortunate situation
in which he found himself, in the judgment of the spectators.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," he began, very earnestly and with a dignified gesture, "I
feel it necessary to explain the truth of this&mdash;" But he was interrupted
by the arrival of a policeman, who pushed his way through the crowd.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>
</div>

<p>"What is this row?" inquired the policeman in his official voice, as he
marched into the room.</p>

<p>The man who was wrestling with Dumnoff was a German and a soldier. At
the authoritative words he relaxed his hold and made an effort to free
himself, a movement of which the Russian instantly took advantage by
throwing his adversary heavily, upsetting another table and thereby
bringing the confusion to its crisis. How far he would have gone if he
had been left to himself is uncertain, for the sudden appearance of two
more men in green coats, helmets and gold collars so emboldened the
spectators of the fight that they advanced in a body just as Dumnoff
threw himself upon the first policeman. The Russian's red face was wet
with perspiration, his small eyes were gleaming ferociously and his
thick hair hung in tangled locks over his forehead, producing with his
fair beard the appearance of a wild animal's mane. But for the timely
assistance of his colleagues, the representatives of the law, and, most
likely the majority of the spectators<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span> would have found themselves in
the street in an exceedingly short space of time. But Dumnoff yielded to
the inevitable; a couple of well-planted blows delivered by the rescuing
party on the sides of his thick skull made him shake his head as a cat
does when its nose is sprinkled with water, and the mujik reluctantly
relinquished the struggle. At the same time the porter who had claimed
the doll came forward and touched his bare head with a military salute.</p>

<p>"What is your name?" asked the first policeman, anxious to get to
business.</p>

<p>"Jacob Goggelmann, Dienstmann number 87, formerly private in the Fourth
Artillery, lately messenger in the Th&uuml;ringer Doll Manufactory."</p>

<p>"Very good," said the policeman, anxious to take the side of his
countryman from the first, and certainly justified in doing so by the
circumstances. "And what is your complaint?"</p>

<p>"That doll, there, on the table," said the porter, "was stolen from me
on New Year's eve, and now that man"&mdash;he pointed to the Count, who stood
stiffly looking on&mdash;"that man has got possession of it."</p>

<p>"And who stole it from you?" inquired the policeman with that acuteness
in the art of cross-examination<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span> for which the police are in all
countries so justly famous.</p>

<p>"Ja, Herr Wachtmeister, if I had known that&mdash;" suggested the porter.</p>

<p>"Of course, of course," interrupted the other. "That man stole the doll
from you, you say?"</p>

<p>"Somebody stole it with my basket, as I stopped to drink a measure in
the yard of the Hofbr&auml;uhaus, and I had to pay for it out of my caution
money, and I lost my place into the bargain, and there lies the accursed
thing."</p>

<p>The policeman, apparently quite satisfied with the porter's story,
turned upon the Count with a blustering and overbearing manner.</p>

<p>"Now, then," he said, roughly, "give an account of yourself. Who are you
and what are you doing here? But that is a foolish question; I know
already that you are a Bohemian and a journeyman tinker."</p>

<p>"A Bohemian? And a journeyman tinker?" repeated the Count, almost
speechless with anger for a moment. "I am neither," he added,
endeavouring to control himself, and settling his refractory collar with
one hand. "I am a Russian gentleman."</p>

<p>"A gentleman&mdash;and a Russian," said the policeman, slowly, as though
putting no faith in the first<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span> statement and very little in the second.
"I think I can provide you with a lodging for the night," he added,
facetiously.</p>

<p>"Slip past me, jump out of the window and run!" whispered the Cossack in
the Count's ear, in Russian.</p>

<p>"What are you saying in your infernal language?" asked the official.</p>

<p>"My friend advised me to run away," said the Count, coolly sitting down,
as though he were master of the situation. "Unfortunately for me, I was
not taught to use my legs in that way when I was a boy."</p>

<p>"I was," said the Cossack. "Good-evening, Master Policeman." He took his
hat from the peg on the wall where it had hung undisturbed throughout
the confusion, and bowing gravely to the man in uniform made as though
he would go out of the room.</p>

<p>"So, so, not quite so fast, my friend," said the policeman, putting
himself in the way. "Heigh! heigh! Stop him! Don't let him go," he
bawled, a second later.</p>

<p>Schmidt had paused a minute, watching his opportunity, then, taking a
quick step backwards, he had vaulted through the open window with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
agility of a cat, and was flying down the empty street at the speed only
attainable by that deceptive domestic animal when pressed for time and
anxious for its own safety.</p>

<p>"Sob&aacute;ka!" growled Domnoff, disgusted at his companion's defection.</p>

<p>"Either talk in a language that human beings can understand, or do not
talk at all," said one of the two men who guarded him.</p>

<p>Seeing that pursuit was useless, the spokesman of the police turned to
the Count, twice as blustering and terrible as before.</p>

<p>"This settles the question," he said. "To the police station you go, you
and your bear-man of an accomplice. Potzbombardendonnerwetter! You
Sappermentskerls! I will teach you to resist the police, to steal dolls
and to jump out of windows! Now then, right about face&mdash;march!"</p>

<p>The Count did not stir from his chair. Dumnoff looked at him as though
to ask instructions of a superior.</p>

<p>"If you can manage one of them, I can take these two," he said in
Russian. Suiting the action to the word, he suddenly bent down, slipped
his arms round the legs of the two policemen, hurled them simultaneously
head over heels and then charged<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span> the crowd, head downwards, upsetting
every one who came in his way, and bursting into the street by sheer
superior weight and impetus. An instant later, his shock head appeared
at the window through which the Cossack had escaped.</p>

<p>"Come along!" he shouted to the Count, in his own language. "I have
locked the street door and they cannot get out. Jump through the
window."</p>

<p>"Go, my friend," answered the Count, calmly. "I will not run away."</p>

<p>"You had much better come," insisted Dumnoff, apparently indifferent to
the noise of the crowd as it tried to force open the closed door, and
shaking off two or three men who had made their way out into the street
with him. He held the key in one hand, and his assailants had small
chance of getting it away.</p>

<p>"You will not come?" he repeated. But the Count shook his head, within
the room.</p>

<p>"Then I will not run away either," said Dumnoff, the good side of his
dull nature showing itself at last. With the utmost indifference to
consequences he returned to the door, unlocked it, and strode through
the midst of the people, who made way readily enough before him, after
their late painful experience of his manner of making way for himself.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have changed my mind," he said, in German, quietly placing himself
between his late keepers, who were alternately rubbing themselves and
brushing the dust off each other's clothes after their tumble.</p>

<p>In the astonished silence which succeeded Dumnoff's return, the Count's
voice was heard again.</p>

<p>"I am both anxious and ready to explain everything, if you will do me
the civility to listen," he said. "The doll is the property of Herr
Fischelowitz, the well-known tobacconist&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We shall see presently what you have to say for yourself," interrupted
the policeman. "We have had enough of these devilish fellows. Come, put
them in handcuffs and off with them. And you three gentlemen," he added,
turning to the three porters, "will have the goodness to accompany us to
the station, in order to give your evidence."</p>

<p>"But my furniture and my beer saucers!" exclaimed the pallid host,
suddenly remembering his losses. "Who is to pay for them?"</p>

<p>The Count answered the question for him.</p>

<p>"You, Master Host, who know us and have had our regular custom for
years, but who have not dared to say a word in our defence throughout
this disgraceful affair, you, I say, deserve to lose all that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span> you have
lost. Nevertheless, I can assure you that I will myself pay for what has
been broken."</p>

<p>The host was not much consoled by this magnanimous promise, which was
received with jeers by the crowd. There was no time, however, to discuss
the question. Dumnoff had quietly submitted his two huge fists to the
handcuffs and a second pair was produced, to fit the Count. At this
indignity he drew himself up proudly.</p>

<p>"Have I resisted the authority, or attempted to run away?" he inquired
with flashing eyes.</p>

<p>The policeman had nothing to say to this very just question.</p>

<p>"Then I advise you to consider what you are doing. In spite of my
appearance, which, I admit, is at present somewhat disorderly, I am a
Russian nobleman, as you will discover so soon as I am submitted to a
properly conducted examination in the presence of your officers. I have
not the least intention of running away, and if this doll was stolen, I
was not connected in any way with the theft. Since I respect the
authorities, I insist upon being respected by them, and if I am treated
in a degrading manner in spite of my protests, there are those in Munich
who will bring the case to proper notice in my own country. I am ready
to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span> accompany you quietly wherever you choose to show me the way."</p>

<p>Something in his manner impressed the officials with the possible truth
of his words. They looked at each other and nodded.</p>

<p>"Very well," said the one who was conducting the arrest.</p>

<p>"Moreover," said the Count, "I crave permission to carry myself the
object of contention, until the other claimant has established his right
of possession."</p>

<p>So saying the Count took the broken Gigerl from the table where it lay,
and carrying it upon his hands before him, like a baby, he solemnly
walked in the direction of the door, thus heading the procession, which
was accompanied into the street by the idlers who had collected inside.</p>

<p>"God be thanked," said the old woman in the corner devoutly, "I have yet
my beer!"</p>

<p>"And to think that only one of them has paid for his supper," moaned the
pale-faced innkeeper, sitting down upon a chair and contemplating the
wreck of his belongings with a haggard eye. The "Gigerl-night" was
remembered for many a long year in the "Green Wreath Inn."</p>

<p>At the police station the arresting party told their own story in their
own way, very much to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span> disadvantage of the Russians and very much in
favour of the porters and of the officials themselves. The latter,
indeed, enlarged so much upon the atrocities perpetrated by Dumnoff as
to weary the superior officer. The Cossack having escaped, the policemen
did not mention him. The officer glanced at Dumnoff.</p>

<p>"Your name?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"Victor Ivanowitch Dumnoff."</p>

<p>"Occupation?"</p>

<p>"Cigarette-maker in the manufactory of Christian Fischelowitz."</p>

<p>"Lock him up," said the officer. "Resisting the police in the execution
of an arrest," he added, speaking to the scribe at his elbow.</p>

<p>"Your name?" continued he, addressing the Count. "Boris Michaelovitch,
Count Skariatine."</p>

<p>"Count?" repeated the officer. "We shall see. Occupation?"</p>

<p>"I have been occupied in the manufacture of cigarettes," answered the
Count. "But as I was only engaged in this during a period of temporary
embarrassment from which I shall be relieved to-morrow, I may be
described as having no particular occupation."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>

<p>The officer stared incredulously for a moment and then nodded to the
scribe in token that he was to write down what was said.</p>

<p>"Charged with having stolen a doll, is that it?" He turned to the
policeman in charge.</p>

<p>"Jawohl, Herr Hauptmann."</p>

<p>"May it please you, Herr Hauptmann, I did not say that," put in the
porter, coming forward.</p>

<p>"Who are you?"</p>

<p>"The man from whom the doll was stolen. Jacob Goggelmann, Dienstmann
number 87, formerly private in the Fourth Artillery, lately messenger in
the Th&uuml;ringer Doll Manufactory."</p>

<p>"When was the doll stolen?"</p>

<p>"Last New Year's eve," answered the porter.</p>

<p>"And you have not seen it until to-day?"</p>

<p>"No, Herr Hauptmann."</p>

<p>"Then how do you know it is the same one? I suppose it is not the only
doll of its kind in Munich."</p>

<p>"I am sure of it. I was a messenger in the shop, Herr Hauptmann, and I
knew everything there, just as though I had been one of the young ladies
who serve the customers. Besides, you will find my name written in
pencil under the pedestal."</p>

<p>"That is another matter," said the officer, taking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span> the Gigerl and
holding it upside down to the gaslight. The reversing of the thing's
natural position produced some mysterious effect upon the musical box,
and the tune which had been so rudely interrupted by Akulina's
well-aimed blow, suddenly began again from the point at which it had
stopped, continuing for a few bars and then coming to an end with a
sharp twang and a little click. The policemen tittered audibly, and even
the captain smiled faintly in his big yellow beard. Then he knit his
brows as he deciphered something which was written on the pinewood under
the base.</p>

<p>"You should have said so at once," he observed. "Your name is there, as
you assert."</p>

<p>"It was written to show that I was to take it. I had it in a basket with
other things. I put it down a moment in the yard of the Hofbr&auml;uhaus, and
when I came back the basket was gone."</p>

<p>"And what do you know about it?" The question was addressed to the
Count.</p>

<p>"Seeing that the porter is evidently right," said the Count, covering
with his hat the point from which the button had been torn, and holding
the other hand rather nervously to his throat, as though trying to keep
himself from falling to pieces, "I have nothing more to say. I will not
be accused of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span> inculpating any one in this disastrous affair. I will
only say that the doll has stood since early in the year in the show
window of Christian Fischelowitz, the tobacconist, who certainly had no
knowledge of the way in which it was obtained by the person who brought
it to him."</p>

<p>"He is an extremely respectable person," observed the officer. "If you
can prove what you say, I will not detain you further. Have you any
witness here?"</p>

<p>"There is Herr Dumnoff," said the Count. The officer smiled and
perpetrated an official jest.</p>

<p>"Herr Dumnoff has given evidence of great strength, but owing to his
peculiar situation at the present time, I cannot trust to the strength
of his evidence."</p>

<p>The policemen laughed respectfully.</p>

<p>"Have you no one else?" asked the officer.</p>

<p>"Herr Fischelowitz will willingly vouch for what I say."</p>

<p>"At this hour, Herr Fischelowitz is doubtless asleep, and would
certainly be justified in refusing to come here out of mere
complaisance. I am afraid, Count Skariatine, that I must have the honour
of being your host until morning."</p>

<p>"It is impossible to describe our relative positions<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span> with greater
courtesy," answered the Count, gravely, and not taking the least notice
of the officer's ironical tone. The latter looked at the speaker
curiously and then suddenly changed his manner. He was convinced that he
was speaking with a gentleman.</p>

<p>"I regret that I am obliged to put you to such inconvenience," he said,
politely. "Treat the gentleman with every consideration," he added,
addressing the policemen in a tone of authority, "and let me have no
complaints of unnecessary rudeness either."</p>

<p>"I thank you, Herr Hauptmann," said the Count, simply.</p>

<p>Thus was the Count deprived of his liberty on the very eve of his return
to all the brilliant advantages of wealth and social station. It was
certainly a most unfortunate train of circumstances which had led him by
such quick stages from his parting with Vjera to the wooden bench and
the board pillow of the police-station. It looked as though the Gigerl
were possessed of an evil spirit determined to work out the Count's
destruction, as though the wretched adventurer who had first stolen it
and palmed it off upon Fischelowitz had laid a curse upon it, whereby it
was destined to breed dissension and strife wherever it remained and to
the direct injury of whomsoever<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span> chanced to possess it for the time
being. It had been the cause of serious disaster to the porter in the
first instance, it had next represented to Fischelowitz a dead loss in
money of fifty marks, it had become a thorn in the side to Akulina, it
had led to one of the most violent quarrels she had ever engaged in with
her husband, its limp and broken form had cost much broken crockery and
some broken furniture to the host of the "Green Wreath Inn," had been
the cause of several ponderous blows dealt and received by Dumnoff, had
produced the violent fall, upon a hard board floor, of a porter and two
policemen and had ultimately brought the Count to prison for the night.
Its value had become very great, for it had been paid for twice over,
once by the man from whom it had been stolen, by the forfeiture of his
caution money, and once by Fischelowitz in the sum of fifty marks lent
to an adventurer; furthermore, the Count had solemnly pledged his word
as a gentleman to pay for it a third time on the morrow, he having in
his worldly possession the sum of one silver mark and two German pennies
at the time of entering into the engagement. The actual sum of money
paid and promised to be paid on the body of the now ruined Gigerl, now
amounted, with interest, to more than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span> four times its original value,
thus constituting one of those interesting problems in real and
comparative value so interesting to the ingenuous political economist,
who believes that all value can be traced to supply and demand. Now,
although the Gigerl was but a single doll, the supply of him, so to
speak, had been surprisingly abundant, and the demand, if represented by
the desire of any one person concerned to possess him, may be
represented by the smallest of zeros. The consideration of so intricate
a question belongs neither to the inventor of fiction nor to the
historian of facts, and may therefore be abandoned to the political
economist, who may, perhaps, be said to partake of the nature of both
while possessing the virtues of neither.</p>

<p>The Count was in prison, therefore, on the eve of his return to
splendour, and his companion in captivity was Dumnoff the mujik. They
found themselves in a well-ventilated room, having high grated windows,
through which the stars were visible, and dimly lighted by a small gas
flame which burned in a lantern of white ground glass. The place was
abundantly, if not luxuriously, furnished with flat wooden pallets, each
having at the head a slanting piece of board supposed to do duty for a
pillow. Outside the open door a policeman paced the broad<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span> passage, a
man taken from the mounted detachment and whose scabbard and spurs
clattered and jingled, hour after hour, as he walked. The sound produced
something half rhythmical, like a broken tune in search of itself, and
the change of sentinels made no perceptible difference in the regular
nature of the unceasing noise.</p>

<p>Dumnoff, relieved of his handcuffs, stretched himself upon the pallet
assigned to him, clasped his hands under the back of his head, and
stared at the ceiling. The Count sat upon the edge of his board,
crossing one knee over the other and looking at his nails, or trying to
look at them in the insufficient light. In some distant part of the
building a door was occasionally opened and shut, and the slight
concussion sent long echoes down the stone passages. The Count sighed
audibly.</p>

<p>"It is not so bad, after all," remarked Dumnoff. "I did not expect to
end the evening so comfortably."</p>

<p>"It is bad enough," said the Count. He produced a crumpled piece of
newspaper which contained a little tobacco, and rolled a cigarette
thoughtfully. "It is bad enough," he repeated as he began to smoke.</p>

<p>"It would have been very easy to get away, if you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span> had done like that
brute of a Schmidt who ran away and left us."</p>

<p>"I do not think Schmidt is a brute," observed the other, blowing a huge
ring of white smoke out into the dusk.</p>

<p>"I did not think so either. But I had arranged it all very well for you
to get away&mdash;only you would not. You see, by an accident, the key was
outside the door, so I kicked the people back and locked it. It would
have taken a quarter of an hour for them to open it, and if you had only
jumped&mdash;"</p>

<p>He turned his head, and glanced at the Count's spare, sinewy figure.</p>

<p>"You are light, too," he continued, "and you could not have hurt
yourself. I cannot understand why you stayed."</p>

<p>"Dumnoff, my friend," said the Count, gravely, "we look at things in a
different way. It is my duty to tell you that I think you behaved in the
most honourable manner, under the circumstances, and I am deeply
indebted to you for the gallant way in which you came back to stand by
me, when you were yourself free. In a nobler warfare, such an action
would have been rewarded with a cross of honour, as it truly deserved.
It is true, as well, that you were not so intimately connected with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
main question at stake, as I was, since it was I who was suspected of
being in possession of unlawfully gotten goods. You were consequently, I
think, at liberty to take your freedom if you could get it, without
consulting your conscience further. Now my position was, and is, very
different. I do not speak of any personal prejudice against the mere act
of running away, considered as an immediate means of escape from
disagreeable circumstances, with the hope of ultimate immunity from all
unpleasant consequences. That is a matter of early education."</p>

<p>"I had very little early education," observed Dumnoff. "And none at all
afterwards."</p>

<p>"My friend, it is not for you and me to enter into the history of our
misfortunes. We have met in the vat of poverty to be seethed alike in
the brew of unhappiness. We have sat at the same daily labour, we have
shared often the same fare, but there is that in each of us which we can
keep sacred from the contamination of confidence, and which will
withstand even the thrusts of poverty. I mean our individual selves, the
better part of us, the nobler element which has suffered, as
distinguished from the grosser, which may yet enjoy. But I am wandering
a little. I am afraid I sometimes do. I return to the point. For me to
take advantage of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span> your generous attempt to free me would have been to
act as though I had a moral cause for flight. In other words, it would
have been to acknowledge that I had committed some dishonourable
action."</p>

<p>"It seems to me that to get away would have been the best way out of it.
They would not have caught you if you had trusted to me, and if they did
not catch you they could not prove anything against you."</p>

<p>"The suspicion would have remained, and the disgrace in my own eyes,"
answered the Count. "The question of physical fear is very different. I
have been told that it depends upon the nerves and the action of the
heart, and that courage is greatly increased by the presence of
nourishment in the stomach. The same cannot be said of moral bravery,
which proceeds more from the fear of seeming contemptible in our own
eyes than from the wish to seem honourable in the estimation of others."</p>

<p>"I daresay," said Dumnoff, who was growing sleepy and who understood
very little of his companion's homily.</p>

<p>"Precisely," replied the latter. "And yet even the question of physical
courage is very complicated in the present case. It cannot be said, for
instance, that you ran away from physical fear, after giving<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span> proof of
such astonishing physical superiority. Your deeds this evening make the
labours of Hercules dwindle to the proportions of mere mountebank's
tricks."</p>

<p>"Was anybody badly injured?" asked Dumnoff, suddenly aroused by the
pleasing recollections of the contest.</p>

<p>"I believe not seriously; I think I saw everybody whom you upset get on
his feet sooner or later."</p>

<p>"Well," said Dumnoff with a sigh, "it cannot be helped. I did my best."</p>

<p>"I should think that you would be glad," suggested the Count. "You
showed your prowess without any fatal result."</p>

<p>"Anything for a change in this dull life," grumbled the peasant with an
air of dissatisfaction.</p>

<p>"With such a prospect of immediate change before me, I suppose I ought
not to blame your longing for excitement. Nevertheless I consider it
fortunate that nothing worse happened."</p>

<p>"You might take me with you to Russia," said Dumnoff, with a short
laugh. "That would be an excitement, at least."</p>

<p>"After the way in which you have stood by me this evening, I will not
refuse you anything. If you wish it, I will take you with me. I take it
for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span> granted that you are not prevented by any especial reason from
entering our country."</p>

<p>"Not that I am aware of," laughed Dumnoff. "Do you know how I got to
Germany? A gentleman from our part of the country brought me with him as
coachman. One day the horses ran away in Baden-Baden, and he turned me
out of the house."</p>

<p>"That was very inconsiderate of him," observed the Count.</p>

<p>"It is true that both the horses were killed," said Dumnoff,
thoughtfully. "And the prince broke his arm, and the carriage was in
good condition for firewood, and possibly I was a little gay&mdash;just a
little&mdash;though I was so much upset by the accident that I could not
remember exactly what happened before. Still&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Your conduct on that particular day seems to have left much to be
desired," remarked the Count with some austerity.</p>

<p>"It has been my bad luck to be in a great many accidents," said the
other. "But that one was remarkable. As far as I can recollect, we drove
into the Grand Duke's four-in-hand on one side and drove out of it on
the other. I never drove through a Grand Duke's equipage on any other
occasion. It was lucky that his Serenity did not happen to be in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span> it
just at the time. There you have my history in a nutshell. As you say
you will take me with you, I thought you ought to know."</p>

<p>"Certainly, certainly," answered the Count, vaguely. "I will take you
with me&mdash;but not as coachman, I think, Dumnoff. We may find some more
favourable sphere for your great physical strength."</p>

<p>"Anything you like. It is a good joke to dream of such a journey, is it
not? Especially when one is locked up for the night in the
police-station."</p>

<p>"It is certainly a relief to contemplate the prospect of such a change
to-morrow," said the Count, his expression brightening in the gloom.</p>

<p>For a few moments there was silence between the two men. Dumnoff's small
eyes fixed themselves on the shadowy outlines of his companion's face,
as though trying to solve a problem far too complicated for his dull
intellect.</p>

<p>"I wonder whether you are really mad," he said slowly, after a prolonged
mental effort.</p>

<p>The Count started slightly and stared at the ex-coachman with a
frightened look.</p>

<p>"Mad?" he repeated, nervously. "Who says I am mad? Why do you ask the
question?"</p>

<p>"Most people say so," replied the other, evidently<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span> without any
intention of giving pain. "Everybody who works with us thinks so."</p>

<p>"Everybody? Everybody? I think you are dreaming, Dumnoff. What do you
mean?"</p>

<p>"I mean that they think so because you have those queer fits of
believing yourself a rich count every week, from Tuesday night till
Thursday morning. Schmidt was saying only yesterday to poor Vjera&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Vjera? Does she believe it too?" asked the Count in an unsteady voice,
not heeding the rest of the speech.</p>

<p>"Of course," said Dumnoff, carelessly. "Schmidt was saying to me only
yesterday that you were going to have a worse attack of it than usual
because you were so silent."</p>

<p>"Vjera, too!" repeated the Count in a low voice. "And no one ever told
me&mdash;" He passed his hand over his eyes.</p>

<p>"Tell me"&mdash;Dumnoff began in the tone of jocular familiarity which he
considered confidential&mdash;"tell me&mdash;the whole thing is just a joke of
yours to amuse us all, is it not? You do not really believe that you are
a count, any more than I really believe that you are mad, you know. You
do not act like a madman, except when you let the police<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span> catch you and
lock you up for the night, instead of running away like a sensible man."</p>

<p>The Count's face grew bright again all at once. In the present state of
his hopes no form of doubt seemed able to take a permanent hold of him.</p>

<p>"No, I am not mad," he said. "But on the other hand, Dumnoff, it is my
conviction that you are exceedingly drunk. No other hypothesis can
account for your very singular remarks about me."</p>

<p>"Oh, I am drunk, am I?" laughed the peasant. "It is very likely, and in
that case I had better go to sleep. Good-night, and do not forget that
you are to take me with you to Russia."</p>

<p>"I will not forget," said the Count.</p>

<p>Dumnoff stretched his heavy limbs on the wooden pallet, rolled his great
head once or twice from side to side until his fur-like hair made
something like a cushion and then, in the course of three minutes, fell
fast asleep.</p>

<p>The Count sat upright in his place, drumming with his fingers upon one
knee.</p>

<p>"It is a wonder that I am not mad," he said to himself. "But Vjera never
thought it of me&mdash;and that fellow is evidently the worse for liquor."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>
</div>

<p>Johann Schmidt had not fled from the scene of action out of any
consideration for his personal safety. He was, indeed, a braver man than
Dumnoff, in proportion as he was more intelligent, and though of a very
different temper, by no means averse to a fight if it came into his way.
He had foreseen what was sure to happen, and had realised sooner than
any one else that the only person who could set everything straight was
Fischelowitz himself. So soon as he was clear of pursuit, therefore, he
turned in the direction of the tobacconist's dwelling, walking as
quickly as he could where there were many people and running at the top
of his speed through such empty by-streets as lay in the direct line of
his course. He rushed up the three flights of steps and rang sharply at
the door.</p>

<p>Akulina's unmistakable step was heard in the passage a moment later.
Schmidt would have preferred that Fischelowitz should have come himself,
though he managed to live on very good terms with Akulina. Though far
from tactful he guessed that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span> in a matter concerning the Count, the
tobacconist would prove more obliging than his wife.</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" inquired the mistress of the house, opening the
door wide after she had recognised the Cossack in the feeble light of
the staircase, by looking through the little hole in the panel.</p>

<p>"Good-evening, Frau Fischelowitz," said Schmidt, trying to appear as
calm and collected as possible. "I would like to speak to your husband
upon a little matter of business."</p>

<p>"He is not at home yet. I left him in the shop."</p>

<p>Almost before the words were out of her mouth, Schmidt had turned and
was running down the stairs, two at a time. Akulina called him back.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute!" she cried, advancing to the hand-rail on the landing.
"What in the world are you in such a hurry about?"</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;nothing&mdash;nothing especial," answered the man, suddenly stopping and
looking up.</p>

<p>Akulina set her fat hands on her hips and held her head a little on one
side. She had plenty of curiosity in her composition.</p>

<p>"Well, I must say," she observed, "for a man who is not in a hurry about
anything, you are uncommonly brisk with your feet. If it is only a
matter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span> of business, I daresay I will do as well as my husband."</p>

<p>"Oh, I daresay," admitted Schmidt, scratching his head. "But this is
rather a personal matter of business, you see."</p>

<p>"And you mean that you want some money, I suppose," suggested Akulina,
at a venture.</p>

<p>"No, no, not at all&mdash;no money at all. It is not a question of money." He
hoped to satisfy her by a statement which was never without charm in her
ears. But Akulina was not satisfied; on the contrary, she began to
suspect that something serious might be the matter, for she could see
Schmidt's face better now, as he looked up to her, facing the gaslight
that burned above her own head. Having been violently angry not more
than an hour or two earlier, her nerves were not altogether calmed, and
the memory of the scene in the shop was still vividly present. There was
no knowing what the Count might not have done, in retaliation for the
verbal injuries she had heaped upon him, and her quick instinct
connected Schmidt's unusually anxious appearance and evident haste to be
off, with some new event in which the Count had played a part.</p>

<p>"Have you seen the Count?" she inquired, just as Schmidt was beginning
to move again.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," answered the latter, trying to assume a doubtful tone of voice.
"I believe&mdash;in fact, I did see him&mdash;for a moment&mdash;"</p>

<p>Akulina smiled to herself, proud of her own acuteness.</p>

<p>"I thought so," she said. "And he has made some trouble about that
wretched doll&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How did you guess that?" asked Schmidt, turning and ascending a few
steps. He was very much astonished.</p>

<p>"Oh, I know many things&mdash;many interesting things. And now you want to
warn my husband of what the Count has done, do you not? It must be
something serious, since you are in such a hurry. Come in, Herr Schmidt,
and have a glass of tea. Fischelowitz will be at home in a few minutes,
and you see I have guessed half your story, so you may as well tell me
the other half and be done with it. It is of no use for you to go to the
shop after him. He has shut up by this time, and you cannot tell which
way he will come home, can you? Much better come in and have a glass of
tea. The samovar is lighted and everything is ready, so that you need
not stay long."</p>

<p>Schmidt lingered doubtfully a moment on the stairs. The closing hour was
certainly past in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span> early-closing Munich, and he might miss the
tobacconist in the street. It seemed wiser to wait for him in his house,
and so the Cossack reluctantly accepted the invitation, which, under
ordinary circumstances, he would have regarded as a great honour.
Akulina ushered him into the little sitting-room and prepared him a
large glass of tea with a slice of lemon in it. She filled another for
herself and sat down opposite to him at the table.</p>

<p>"The poor Count!" she exclaimed. "He is sure to get himself into trouble
some day. I suppose people cannot help behaving oddly when they are mad,
poor things. And the Count is certainly mad, Herr Schmidt."</p>

<p>"Quite mad, poor man. He has had one of his worst attacks to-day."</p>

<p>"Yes," assented the wily Akulina, "and if you could have seen him and
heard him in the shop this evening&mdash;" She held up her hands and shook
her head.</p>

<p>"What did he do and say?"</p>

<p>"Oh, such things, such things! Poor man, of course I am very sorry for
him, and I am glad that my husband finds room to employ him, and keep
him from starving. But really, this evening he quite made me lose my
temper. I am afraid I was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span> a little rough, considering that he is
sensitive. But to hear the man talk about his money, and his titles, and
his dignities, when he is only just able to keep body and soul together!
It is enough to irritate the seven archangels, Herr Schmidt, indeed it
is! And then at the same time there was that dreadful Gigerl, and my
head was splitting&mdash;I am sure there will be a thunder-storm
to-night&mdash;altogether, I could not bear it any longer, and I actually
upset the Gigerl out of anger, and it rolled to the floor and was
broken. Of course it is very foolish to lose one's temper in that way,
but after all, I am only a weak woman, and I confess it was a relief to
me when I saw the poor Count take the thing away. I hope I did not
really hurt his feelings, for he is an excellent workman, in spite of
his madness. What did he say, Herr Schmidt? I would so like to know how
he took it. Of course he was very angry. Poor man, so mad, so completely
mad on that one point!"</p>

<p>"To tell the truth," said Schmidt, who had listened attentively, "he did
not like what you said to him at all."</p>

<p>"Well, really, was it my fault, Herr Schmidt? I am only a woman, and I
suppose I may be excused if I lose my temper once in a year or so. It
is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span> very wearing on the nerves. Every Tuesday evening begins the same
old song about the fortune and letters, and the journey to Russia. One
gets very tired of it in the long-run. At first it used to amuse me."</p>

<p>"Do you think that Herr Fischelowitz can have gone anywhere else instead
of coming home?" asked the Cossack, finishing the glass of tea, which he
had swallowed burning hot out of sheer anxiety to get away.</p>

<p>"Oh no, indeed," cried Akulina in a tone of the most sincere conviction.
"He always tells me where he is going. You have no idea what a good
husband he is, and what a good man&mdash;though I daresay you know that after
being with us so many years. Now, I am sure that if he had the least
idea that anything had happened to the poor Count, he would run all the
way home in order to hear it as soon as possible."</p>

<p>"No more tea, thank you, Frau Fischelowitz," said Schmidt, but she took
his glass with a quiet smile and shredded a fresh piece of lemon into it
and filled it up again, quite heedless of his protest. Schmidt resigned
himself, and thanked her civilly.</p>

<p>"Of course," she said, presently, as she busied herself with the
arrangements of the samovar, "of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span> course it is nothing so very serious,
is it? I daresay the Count has told you that he would not work any more
for us, and you are anxious to arrange the matter? In that case, you
need have no fear. I am always ready to forgive and forget, as they say,
though I am only a weak woman."</p>

<p>"That is very kind of you," observed Schmidt, with a glitter in his eyes
which Akulina did not observe.</p>

<p>"I guessed the truth, did I not?"</p>

<p>"Not exactly. The trouble is rather more serious than that. The fact is,
as we were at supper, a man at another table saw the Gigerl in our hands
and swore that it had been stolen from him some months ago."</p>

<p>"And what happened then?" asked Akulina with sudden interest.</p>

<p>"I suppose you may as well know," said Schmidt, regretfully. "There was
a row, and the man made a great deal of trouble and at last the police
were called in, and I came to get Herr Fischelowitz himself to come and
prove that the Gigerl was his. You see why I am in such a hurry."</p>

<p>"Do you think they have arrested the Count?"</p>

<p>"I imagine that every one concerned would be taken to the
police-station."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>

<p>"And then?"</p>

<p>"And then, unless the affair is cleared up, they will be kept there all
night."</p>

<p>"All night!" exclaimed Akulina, holding up her hands in real or affected
horror. "Poor Count! He will be quite crazy, now, I fear&mdash;especially as
this is Tuesday evening."</p>

<p>"But he must be got out at once!" cried Schmidt in a tone of decision.
"Herr Fischelowitz will surely not allow&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No indeed! You have only to wait until he comes home, and then you can
go together. Or better still, if he does not come back in a quarter of
an hour, and if he has really shut up the shop as usual, you might look
for him at the Caf&eacute; Luitpold, and if he is not there, it is just
possible that he may have looked in at the G&auml;rtner Platz Theatre, for
which he often has free tickets, and if the performance is over&mdash;I fancy
it is, by this time&mdash;he may be in the Caf&eacute; Maximilian, or he may have
gone to drink a glass of beer in the Platzl, for he often goes there,
and&mdash;well, if you do not find him in any of those places&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But, good Heavens, Frau Fischelowitz, you said you were quite sure he
was coming home at once! Now I have lost all this time!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>

<p>Schmidt had risen quickly to his feet, in considerable anxiety and
haste. Akulina smiled good-humouredly.</p>

<p>"You see," she said, "it is just possible that to-night, as he was a
little annoyed with me for being sharp with the Count, he may have gone
somewhere without telling me. But I really could not foresee it, because
he is such a very good&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know," interrupted the Cossack. "If I miss him, you will tell him,
will you not? Thank you, and good-night, Frau Fischelowitz, I cannot
afford to wait a moment longer."</p>

<p>So saying Johann Schmidt made for the door and got out of the house this
time without any attempt on the part of his amiable hostess to detain
him further. She had indeed omitted to tell him that her last speech was
not merely founded on a supposition, since Fischelowitz had really been
very much annoyed and had declared that he would not come home but would
spend the evening with a friend of his who lived in the direction of
Schwabing, one of the suburbs of Munich farthest removed from the places
in which she advised Schmidt to make search.</p>

<p>The stout housewife disliked and even detested the Count for many
reasons all good in her own eyes, among which the chief one was that she
did<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span> dislike him. She felt for him one of those strong and invincible
antipathies which trivial and cunning natures often feel for very
honourable and simple ones. To the latter the Count belonged, and
Akulina was a fine specimen of the former. If the Count had been
literally starving and clothed in rags, he would have been incapable of
a mean thought or of a dishonest action. Whatever his origin had been,
he had that, at least, of a nobility undeniable in itself. That his
character was simple in reality, may as yet seem less evident. He was
regarded as mad, as has been seen, but his madness was methodical and
did not overstep certain very narrow bounds. Beyond those limits within
which others, at least, did not consider him responsible, his chief idea
seemed to be to gain his living quietly, owing no man anything, nor
refusing anything to any man who asked it. This last characteristic,
more than any other, seemed to prove the possibility of his having been
brought up in wealth and with the free use of money, for his generosity
was not that of the vulgar spendthrift who throws away his possessions
upon himself quite as freely as upon his companions. He earned enough
money at his work to live decently well, at least, and he spent but the
smallest sum upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span> his own wants. Nevertheless he never had anything to
spare for his own comfort, for he was as ready to give a beggar in the
street the piece of silver which represented a good part of the value of
his day's work as most rich people are to part with a penny. He never
inquired the reason for the request of help, but to all who asked of him
he gave what he had, gravely, without question, as a matter of course.
If Dumnoff's pockets were empty and his throat dry, he went to the Count
and got what he wanted. Dumnoff might be brutal, rude, coarse; it made
no difference. The Count did not care to know where the money went nor
when it would be returned, if ever. If Schmidt's wife&mdash;for he had a
wife&mdash;was ill, the Count lent all he had, if the children's shoes were
worn out, he lent again, and when Schmidt, who was himself extremely
conscientious in his odd way, brought the money back, the Count
generally gave it to the first poor person whom he met. Akulina supposed
that this habit belonged to his madness. Others, who understood him
better, counted it to him for righteousness, and even Dumnoff, the rough
peasant, showed at times a friendly interest in him, which is not
usually felt by the unpunctual borrower towards the uncomplaining
lender.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>

<p>But Akulina could understand none of these things. She belongs by nature
to the class of people whose first impulse on all occasions is to say:
"Money is money." There can be no mutual attraction of intellectual
sympathy between these, and those other persons who despise money in
their hearts, and would rather not touch it with their hands. It has
been seen also that the events connected with the Gigerl's first
appearance in the shop had been of a nature to irritate Akulina still
more. The dislike nourished in her stout bosom through long months and
years now approached the completion of its development, and manifested
itself as a form of active hatred. Akulina was delighted to learn that
there was a prospect of the Count's spending the night in the
police-station and she determined that Johann Schmidt should not find
her husband before the next day, and that when the partner of her bliss
returned&mdash;presumably pacified by the soothing converse of his
friend&mdash;she would not disturb his peace of mind by any reference to the
Count's adventures. It was therefore with small prospect of success that
the Cossack began his search for Fischelowitz.</p>

<p>Only a man who has sought anxiously for another, all through the late
evening, in a great city, knows<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span> how hopeless the attempt seems after
the first hour. The rapid motion through many dusky streets, the looking
in, from time to time, upon some merry company assembled in a warm room
under a brilliant light, the anxious search among the guests for the
familiar figure, the disappointment, as each fancied resemblance shows,
on near approach, a face unknown to the searcher, the hurried exit and
the quick passage through the dark night air to the next
halting-place&mdash;all these impressions, following hurriedly upon each
other, confuse the mind and at last discourage hope.</p>

<p>Schmidt did not realise how late it was, when, abandoning his search for
his employer, he turned towards the police-station in the hope of still
rendering some assistance to his friend. He could not gain admittance to
the presence of the officer in charge, however, and was obliged to
content himself with the assurance that the Count had been treated "with
consideration," as the phrase was, and that there would be plenty of
time for talking in the morning. The policemen in the guard-room were
sleepy and not disposed to enter into conversation. Schmidt turned his
steps in the direction of the tobacconist's house for the second time,
in sheer despair. But he found the street door shut<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span> and the whole house
was dark. Nevertheless, he pulled the little handle upon which, by the
aid of a flickering match, he discovered a figure of three,
corresponding to the floor occupied by Fischelowitz. Again and again he
tugged vigorously at the brass knob until he could hear the bell
tinkling far above. No other sound followed, however, in the silence of
the night, though he strained his ears for the faintest echo of a
distant footfall and the slightest noise indicating that a window or a
door was about to be opened. He wondered whether Fischelowitz had come
home. If he had, Akulina had surely told him the story of the evening,
and he would have been heard of at the police-station, for it was
incredible that he should let the night pass without making an effort to
liberate the Count. Therefore the tobacconist had in all probability not
yet returned. The night was fairly warm, and the Cossack sat down upon a
doorstep, lighted a cigarette and waited. In spite of long years spent
in the midst of German civilisation, it was still as natural to him to
sit down in the open air at night and to watch the stars, as though he
had never changed his own name for the plain German appellation of
Johann Schmidt, nor laid aside the fur cap and the sheepskin coat of his
tribe for the shabby jacket<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span> and the rusty black hat of higher social
development.</p>

<p>There was no truth in Akulina's statement that a thunder-storm was
approaching. The stars shone clear and bright, high above the narrow
street, and the solitary man looked up at them, and remembered other
days and a freer life and a broader horizon; days when he had been
younger than he was now, a life full of a healthier labour, a horizon
boundless as that of the little street was limited. He thought, as he
often thought when alone in the night, of his long journeys on
horseback, driving great flocks of bleating sheep over endless steppes
and wolds and expanses of pasture and meadow; he remembered the
reddening of the sheep's woolly coats in the evening sun, the quick
change from gold to grey as the sun went down, the slow transition from
twilight to night, the uncertain gait of his weary beast as the darkness
closed in, the soft sound of the sheep huddling together, the bark of
his dog, the sudden, leaping light of the camp-fire on the distant
rising ground, the voices of greeting, the bubbling of the soup kettle,
the grateful rest, the song of the wandering Tchum&aacute;k&mdash;the pedlar and
roving newsman of the Don. He remembered on holidays the wild racing and
chasing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span> and the sports in the saddle, the picking up of the tiny
ten-kopek bit from the earth at a full gallop, the startling game in
which a row of fearless Cossack girls join hands together, daring the
best rider to break their rank with his plunging horse if he can, the
mad laughter of the maidens, the snorting and rearing of the animal as
he checks himself before the human wall that will not part to make way
for him. All these things he recalled, the change of the seasons, the
iron winter, the scorching summer, the glory of autumn and the freshness
of spring. Born to such a liberty, he had fallen into the captivity of a
common life; bred in the desert, he knew that his declining years would
be spent in the eternal cutting of tobacco in the close air of a back
shop; trained to the saddle, he spent his days seated motionless upon a
wooden chair. The contrast was bitter enough, between the life he was
meant to lead by nature, and the life he was made to lead by
circumstances. And all this was the result in the first instant of a
girl's caprice, of her fancy for another man, so little different from
himself that a Western woman could hardly have told the two apart. For
this, he had left the steppe, had wandered westward to the Dnieper and
southward to Odessa, northward again to Kiew, to Moscow, to
Nizni-Novgorod, back<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span> again to Poland, to Krakau, to Prague, to Munich
at last. Who could remember his wanderings, or trace the route of his
endless journeyings? Not he himself, surely, any more than he could
explain the gradual steps by which he had been transformed from a Don
Cossack to a German tobacco-cutter in a cigarette manufactory.</p>

<p>But his past life at least furnished him with memories, varied,
changing, full of light and life and colour, wherewith to while away an
hour's watching in the night. Still he sat upon his doorstep, watching
star after star as it slowly culminated over the narrow street and set,
for him, behind the nearest house-top. He might have sat there till
morning had he not been at last aware that some one was walking upon the
opposite pavement.</p>

<p>His quick ear caught the soft fall of an almost noiseless footstep and
he could distinguish a shadow a little darker than the surrounding
shade, moving quickly along the wall. He rose to his feet and crossed
the street, not believing, indeed, that the newcomer could be the man he
wanted, but anxious to be fully satisfied that he was not mistaken. He
found himself face to face with a young girl, who stopped at the street
door of the tobacconist's house,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span> just as he reached it. Her head was
muffled in something dark and he could not distinguish her features. She
started on seeing him, hesitated and then laid her hand upon the same
knob which Schmidt had pulled so often in vain.</p>

<p>"It is of no use to ring," he said, quietly. "I have given it up."</p>

<p>"Herr Schmidt!" exclaimed the girl in evident delight. It was Vjera.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;but, in Heaven's name, Vjera, what are you doing here at this hour
of the night? You ought to be at home and asleep."</p>

<p>"Oh, you have not heard the dreadful news," cried poor Vjera in accents
of distress. "Oh, if we cannot get in here, come with me, for the love
of Heaven, and help me to get him out of that horrible place&mdash;oh, if you
only knew what has happened!"</p>

<p>"I know all about it, Vjera," answered the Cossack. "That is the reason
why I am here. I was with them when it happened and I ran off to get
Fischelowitz. As ill luck would have it, he was out."</p>

<p>In a few words Schmidt explained the whole affair and told of his own
efforts. Vjera was breathless with excitement and anxiety.</p>

<p>"What is to be done? Dear Herr Schmidt!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span> What is to be done?" She wrung
her hands together and fixed her tearful eyes on his.</p>

<p>"I am afraid that there is nothing to be done until morning&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But there must be something, there shall be something done! They will
drive him mad in that dreadful place&mdash;he is so proud and so
sensitive&mdash;you do not know&mdash;the mere idea of being in prison&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is not so bad as that," answered Schmidt, trying to reassure her.
"They assured me that he was treated with every consideration, you know.
Of course that means that he was not locked up like a common prisoner."</p>

<p>"Do you think so?" Vjera's tone expressed no conviction in the matter.</p>

<p>"Certainly. And it shows that he is not really suspected of anything
serious&mdash;only, because Fischelowitz could not be found&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But he is there&mdash;there in his house, asleep!" cried Vjera. "And we can
wake him up&mdash;of course we can. He cannot be sleeping so soundly as not
to hear if we ring hard. At least his wife will hear and look out of the
window."</p>

<p>"I am afraid not. I have tried it."</p>

<p>But Vjera would not be discouraged and laid hold<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span> of the bell-handle
again, pulling it out as far as it would come and letting it fly back
again with a snap. The same results followed as when Schmidt had made
the same attempt. There was a distant tinkling followed by total
silence. Vjera repeated the operation.</p>

<p>"You cannot do more than I have done," said her companion, leaning his
back against the door and watching her movements.</p>

<p>"I ought to do more."</p>

<p>"Why, Vjera?"</p>

<p>"Because he is more to me than to you or to any of the rest," she
answered in a low voice.</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say that you love the Count?" inquired Schmidt,
surprised beyond measure by the girl's words and rendered thereby even
more tactless than usual.</p>

<p>But Vjera said nothing, having been already led into saying more than
she had wished to say. She pulled the bell again.</p>

<p>"I had never thought of that," remarked the Cossack in a musing tone.
"But he is mad, Vjera, the poor Count is mad. It is a pity that you
should love a madman&mdash;"</p>

<p>"O, don't, Herr Schmidt&mdash;please don't!" cried Vjera, imploring him to be
silent as much with her eyes as with her voice.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, but really," continued the other, as though talking to himself,
"there are things that go beyond all imagination in this world. Now, who
would ever have thought of such a thing?"</p>

<p>This time Vjera did not make any answer, nor repeat her request. But as
she tugged with all her might at the brass handle, the Cossack heard a
quick sob, and then another.</p>

<p>"Poor Vjera!" he exclaimed kindly, and laying his hand on her shoulder.
"Poor child! I am very sorry for you, poor Vjera&mdash;I would do anything to
help you, indeed I would&mdash;if I only knew what it should be."</p>

<p>"Then help me to wake up Fischelowitz," answered the girl in a shaken
voice. "I am sure he is at home at this time&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I have done all I can. If he will not wake, he will not. Or if he is
awake he will not put his head out of the window, which is much the same
thing so far as we are concerned. By the bye, Vjera, you have not told
me how you came to hear of the row. It is queer that you should have
heard of it&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Herr Homolka&mdash;you know, my landlord&mdash;had seen the Count go by with the
Gigerl and the policemen. He asked some one in the crowd and learned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
the story. But it was late when he came home, and he told us&mdash;I was
sitting up sewing with his wife&mdash;and then I ran here. But do please help
me&mdash;we can do something, I am sure."</p>

<p>"I do not see what, short of climbing up the flat walls of the house.
But I am not a lizard, you know."</p>

<p>"We might call. Perhaps they would hear our voices if we called
together," suggested Vjera, drawing back into the middle of the street
and looking up at the closed windows of the third story.</p>

<p>"Herr Fischelowitz!" she cried, in a shrill, weak tone that seemed to
find no echo in the still air.</p>

<p>"Herr Fischelowitz, Fischelowitz, Fischelowitz!" bawled the Cossack,
taking up the idea and putting it into very effective execution. His
brazen voice, harsh and high, almost made the windows rattle.</p>

<p>"Somebody will hear that," he observed and cleared his throat for
another effort.</p>

<p>A number of persons heard it, and at the first repetition of the yell,
two or three windows were angrily opened. A head in a white nightcap
looked out from the first story.</p>

<p>"What do you want at this hour of the night?" asked the owner of the
nightcap, already in a rage.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>

<p>"I want Herr Fischelowitz, who lives in this house," answered the
Cossack, firmly.</p>

<p>"Do you live here? Are you shut out?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;we only want&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then go to the devil!" roared the infuriated German, shutting his
window again with a vicious slam. A grunt of satisfaction from other
directions was followed by the shutting of other windows, and presently
all was silent again.</p>

<p>"I am afraid they sleep at the back of the house," said Vjera, growing
despondent at last.</p>

<p>"I am afraid so, too," answered Johann Schmidt, proudly conscious that
the noise he had made would have disturbed the slumbers of the Seven
Sleepers of Ephesus.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>
</div>

<p>"You had better let me take you home," said Schmidt, kindly, after the
total failure of the last effort.</p>

<p>Vjera seemed to be stupefied by the sense of disappointment. She went
back to the door of the tobacconist's house and put out her hand as
though to ring the bell again then, realising how useless the attempt
would be, she let her arms fall by her sides and leaned against the
door-post, her muffled head bent forward and her whole attitude
expressing her despair.</p>

<p>"Come, come, Vjera," said the Cossack in an encouraging tone, "it is not
so bad after all. By this time the Count is fast asleep and is dreaming
of his fortune, you know, so that it would be a cruelty to wake him up.
In the morning we will all go with Fischelowitz and have him let out,
and he will be none the worse."</p>

<p>"I am afraid he will be&mdash;very much the worse," said Vjera. "It is
Wednesday to-morrow, and if he wakes up there&mdash;oh, I do not dare think
of it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span> It will make him quite, quite mad. Can we do nothing more?
Nothing?"</p>

<p>"I think we have done our best to wake up this quarter of the town, and
yet Fischelowitz is still asleep. No one else can be of any use to
us&mdash;therefore&mdash;" he stopped, for his conclusion seemed self-evident.</p>

<p>"I suppose so," said Vjera, regretfully. "Let us go, then."</p>

<p>She turned and with her noiseless step began to walk slowly away,
Schmidt keeping close by her side. For some minutes neither spoke. The
streets were deserted, dry and still.</p>

<p>"Do you think there is any truth at the bottom of the Count's story?"
asked the Cossack at last.</p>

<p>"I do not know," Vjera answered, shaking her head. "I do not know what
to think," she continued after a little pause. "He tells us all the same
thing, he speaks of his letters, but he never shows them to anyone. I am
afraid&mdash;" she sighed and stopped speaking.</p>

<p>"I will tell you this much," said her companion. "That man is honest to
the backbone, honest as the good daylight on the hills, where there are
no houses to darken it and make shadows."</p>

<p>"He is an angel of goodness and kindness," said Vjera softly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span></p>

<p>"I know he is. Is he not always helping others when he is starving
himself? Now what I say is this. No man who is as good and as honest as
he is, can have become so mad about a mere piece of fancy&mdash;about an
invented lie, to be plain. What there is in his story I do not know, but
I am sure that there was truth in it once. It may have been a long time
ago, but there was a time once, when he had some reason to expect the
money and the titles he talks of every Tuesday evening."</p>

<p>"Do you really think that?" asked Vjera, eagerly. Her own understanding
had never gone so far in its deduction.</p>

<p>"I am sure of it. I know nothing about mad people, but I am sure that no
honest man ever invented a story out of nothing and then became crazy
because it did not turn out true."</p>

<p>"But you, who have travelled so much, Herr Schmidt, have you ever heard
the name before&mdash;have you ever heard of such a family?"</p>

<p>"I have a bad memory for names, but I believe I have. I cannot be sure.
It makes no difference. It is a good Russian name, in any case, and a
gentleman's name, I should think. Of course I only mean that I&mdash;that you
should not think that because I&mdash;in fact," blundered out the good man,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
"you must not suppose that you will be a real countess, you know."</p>

<p>"I?" exclaimed Vjera, with a nervous, hysterical laugh, which the
Cossack supposed to be genuine.</p>

<p>"That is all I wanted to say," he continued in a tone of relief, as
though he felt that he had done his duty in warning the poor girl of a
possible disappointment. "It may be true&mdash;of course, and I am sure that
it once was, or something like it, but I do not believe he has any
chance of getting his own after so long."</p>

<p>"I cannot think of it&mdash;in either way. If it is all an old forgotten tale
which he believes in still-why then, he is mad. Is it not dreadful to
see? So quiet and sensible all the week, and then, on Tuesday night, his
farewell speech to us all&mdash;every Tuesday&mdash;and his disappointment the
next day, and then a new week begun without any recollection of it all!
It is breaking my heart, Herr Schmidt!"</p>

<p>"Indeed, poor Vjera, you look as though it were."</p>

<p>"And yet, and yet&mdash;I do not know. I think that if it were one day to
turn out true&mdash;then my heart would be quite broken, for he would go
away, and I should never see him again."</p>

<p>Accustomed as she was to daily association with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span> the man who was walking
by her side, knowing his good heart and feeling his sympathy, it is
small wonder that the lonely girl should have felt impelled to unburden
her soul of some of its bitterness. If her life had gone on as usual,
undisturbed by anything from without, the confessions which now fell
from her lips so easily would never have found words. But she had been
unsettled by what had happened in the early evening, and unstrung by her
great anxiety for the Count's safety. Her own words sounded in her ear
before she knew that she was going to speak them.</p>

<p>"I am sure that something dreadful is going to happen," she continued
after a moment's pause. "He will go mad in that horrible prison, raving
mad, so that they will have to&mdash;to hold him&mdash;" she sobbed and then
recovered herself by an effort. "Or else&mdash;he will fall ill and die,
after it&mdash;" Here she broke down completely and stopping in the middle of
the street began crying bitterly, clutching at Schmidt's arm as though
to keep from falling.</p>

<p>"I should not wonder," he said, but she fortunately did not catch the
words.</p>

<p>He was very sorry for the poor girl, and felt inclined to take her in
his arms and carry her to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span> her home, for he saw that she was weak and
exhausted as well as overcome by her anxiety. Before resorting to such a
measure, however, he thought it best to try to encourage her to walk on.</p>

<p>"Nothing that one expects, ever happens," he said confidently, and
passing his arm through hers, as though to lead her away. "Come, you
will be at home presently and then you will go to bed and in the
morning, before you are at the shop, everything will have been set
right, and I daresay the Count will be there before you, and looking as
well as ever."</p>

<p>"How can you say that, when you know that he never comes on Wednesdays!"
exclaimed Vjera through her tears. "I am sure something dreadful will
happen to him. No, not that way&mdash;not that way!"</p>

<p>Schmidt was trying to guide her round a sharp corner, but she resisted
him.</p>

<p>"But that is the way home," protested the Cossack.</p>

<p>"I know, but I cannot go home, until I have seen where he is. I must
go&mdash;you must not prevent me!"</p>

<p>"To the police-station?" inquired Schmidt in considerable astonishment.
"They will not let us<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span> go in, you know. You cannot possibly see him.
What good can it do you to go and look at the place?"</p>

<p>"You do not understand, Herr Schmidt! You are good and kind, but you do
not understand me. Pray, pray come with me, or let me go alone. I will
go alone, if you do not want to come. I am not at all afraid&mdash;but I must
go."</p>

<p>"Well, child," answered Schmidt, good-humouredly. "I will go with you,
since you are so determined."</p>

<p>"Is this the way? Are you not misleading me? Oh, I am sure I shall never
see him again&mdash;quick, let us walk quickly, Herr Schmidt! Only think what
he may be suffering at this very moment!"</p>

<p>"I am sure he is asleep, my dear child. And when we are outside of the
police-station we cannot know what is going on inside, whether our
friend is asleep or awake, and it can do no good whatever to go. But
since you really wish it so much, we are going there as fast as we can,
and I promise to take you by the shortest way."</p>

<p>Her step grew more firm as they went on and he felt that there was more
life in the hand that rested on his arm. The prospect of seeing the
walls of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span> the place in which the Count was unwillingly spending the
night gave Vjera fresh strength and courage. The way was long, as
distances are reckoned in Munich, and more than ten minutes elapsed
before they reached the building. A sentry was pacing the pavement under
the glare of the gaslight, his shadow lengthening, shortening,
disappearing and lengthening again on the stone-way as he walked slowly
up and down. Vjera and her companion stopped on the other side of the
street. The sentinel paid no attention to them.</p>

<p>"You are quite sure it is there?" asked the girl, under her breath.
Schmidt nodded instead of answering.</p>

<p>"Then I will pray that all may be well this night," she said.</p>

<p>She dropped the Cossack's arm and slipped away from him; then pausing at
a little distance, in the deep shadow of an archway opposite the
station, she knelt down upon the pavement, and taking some small object,
which was indistinguishable in the darkness, from the bosom of her frock
she clasped her hands together and looked upwards through the gloom at
the black walls of the great building. The Cossack looked at her in a
sort of half-stupid, half-awed surprise, scarcely understanding what
she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span> was doing at first, and feeling his heart singularly touched when
he realised that she was praying out here in the street, kneeling on the
common pavement of the city, as though upon the marble floor of a
church, and actually saying prayers&mdash;he could hear low sounds of earnest
tone escaping from her lips&mdash;prayers for the man she loved, because he
was shut up for the night in the police-station like an ordinary
disturber of the peace. He was touched, for the action, in its
simplicity of faith, set in vibration the chords of a nature accustomed
originally to simple things, simple hopes, simple beliefs.
Instinctively, as he watched her, Johann Schmidt raised his hat from his
round head for a moment, and if he had possessed any nearer acquaintance
with praying in general or with any prayer in particular it is almost
certain that his lips would have moved. As it was, he felt sorry for
Vjera, he hoped that the Count would be none the worse for his
adventure, and he took off his hat. Let it be counted to him for
righteousness.</p>

<p>As for poor Vjera herself, she was so much in earnest that she
altogether forgot where she was. For love, it has been found, is a great
suggester of prayer, if not of meditation, and when the beloved one is
in danger a little faith seems magnified to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span> such dimensions as would
certainly accept unhesitatingly a whole mountain of dogmas. Vjera's
ideas were indeed confused, and she would have found it hard to define
the result which she so confidently expected. But if that result were to
be in any proportion to her earnestness of purpose and sincerity of
heart, it could not take a less imposing shape than a direct
intervention of Providence, at the very least; and as the poor Polish
girl rose from her knees she would hardly have been surprised to see the
green-coated sentinel thrust aside by legions of angelic beings,
hastening to restore to her the only treasure her humble life knew of,
or dreamed of, or cared for.</p>

<p>But as the visions which her prayers had called before her faded away
into the night, she saw again the dingy walls of the hated building, the
gilt spike on the helmet of the policeman and the shining blade that
caught the light as he moved on his beat. For one moment Vjera stood
quite still. Then with a passionate gesture she stretched out both arms
before her, as though to draw out to herself, by sheer strength of
longing, the man whose life she felt to be her own&mdash;and at last, wearied
and exhausted, but no longer despairing altogether, she covered her face
with her hands and repeated again and again<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span> the two words which made up
the burden of her supplication.</p>

<p>"Save him, save him, save him!" she whispered to herself.</p>

<p>When she looked up, at last, Schmidt was by her side. There was
something oddly respectful in his attitude and manner as he stood there
awaiting her pleasure, ready to be guided by her whithersoever she
pleased. It seemed to him that on this evening he had begun to see Vjera
in a new light, and that she was by no means the poor, insignificant
little shell-maker he had always supposed her to be. It seemed to him
that she was transformed into a woman, and into a woman of strong
affections and brave heart. And yet he knew every outline of her plain
face, and had known every change of her expression for years, since she
had first come to the shop, a mere girl not yet thirteen years of age.
Nor had it been from lack of observation that he had misunderstood her,
for like most men born and bred in the wilderness, he watched faces and
tried to read them. The change had taken place in Vjera herself and it
must be due, he thought, to her love for the poor madman. He smiled to
himself in the dark, scarcely understanding why. It was strange to him
perhaps that madness on the one side<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span> should bring into life such a
world of love on the other.</p>

<p>Vjera turned towards him and once more laid her hand upon his arm.</p>

<p>"Thank you," she said. "I could not have slept if I had not come here
first, and it was very good of you. I will go home, but do not come with
me&mdash;you must be tired."</p>

<p>"I am never tired," he answered, and they began to walk away in the
direction whence they had come.</p>

<p>For a long time neither spoke. At last Schmidt broke the silence.</p>

<p>"Vjera," he said, "I have been thinking about it all and I do not
understand it. What kind of love is it that makes you act as you do?"</p>

<p>Vjera stood still, for they were close to her door, and there was a
street lamp at hand so that she could see his face. She saw that he
asked the question earnestly.</p>

<p>"It is something that I cannot explain&mdash;it is something holy," she
answered.</p>

<p>Perhaps the forlorn little shell-maker had found the definition of true
love.</p>

<p>She let herself in with her key and Schmidt once more found himself
alone in the street. If he had followed his natural instinct he would
have loitered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span> about in one of the public squares until morning, making
up for the loss of his night's rest by sleeping in the daytime. But he
had taken upon himself the responsibilities of marriage as they are
regarded west of the Dnieper, and his union had been blessed by the
subsequent appearance of a number of olive-branches. It was therefore
necessary that he should sleep at night in order to work by day, and he
reluctantly turned his footsteps towards home. As he walked, he thought
of all that had happened since five o'clock in the afternoon, and of all
that he had learned in the course of the night. Vjera's story interested
him and touched him, and her acts seemed to remind him of something
which he nevertheless could not quite remember. Far down in his
toughened nature the strings of a forgotten poetry vibrated softly as
though they would make music if they dared. Far back in the chain of
memories, the memory once best loved was almost awake once more, the
link of once clasped hands was almost alive again, the tender pressure
of fingers now perhaps long dead was again almost a reality able to
thrill body and soul. And with all that, and with the certainty that
those things were gone for ever, arose the great longing for one more
breath of liberty, for one more ride over the boundless<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span> steppe, for one
more draught of the sour kvass, of the camp brew of rye and malt.</p>

<p>The longing for such things, for one thing almost unattainable, is in
man and beast at certain times. In the distant northern plains, a
hundred miles from the sea, in the midst of the Laplander's village, a
young reindeer raises his broad muzzle to the north wind, and stares at
the limitless distance while a man may count a hundred. He grows
restless from that moment, but he is yet alone. The next day, a dozen of
the herd look up, from the cropping of the moss, snuffing the breeze.
Then the Laps nod to one another, and the camp grows daily more unquiet.
At times, the whole herd of young deer stand at gaze, as it were,
breathing hard through wide nostrils, then jostling each other and
stamping the soft ground. They grow unruly and it is hard to harness
them in the light sledge. As the days pass, the Laps watch them more and
more closely, well knowing what will happen sooner or later. And then at
last, in the northern twilight, the great herd begins to move. The
impulse is simultaneous, irresistible, their heads are all turned in one
direction. They move slowly at first, biting still, here and there, at
the bunches of rich moss. Presently the slow step becomes a trot, they
crowd<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span> closely together while the Laps hasten to gather up their last
unpacked possessions, their cooking utensils and their wooden gods. The
great herd break together from a trot to a gallop, from a gallop to a
break-neck race, the distant thunder of their united tread reaches the
camp during a few minutes, and they are gone to drink of the polar sea.
The Laps follow after them, dragging painfully their laden sledges in
the broad track left by the thousands of galloping beasts&mdash;a day's
journey, and they are yet far from the sea, and the trail is yet broad.
On the second day it grows narrower, and there are stains of blood to be
seen; far on the distant plain before them their sharp eyes distinguish
in the direct line a dark, motionless object, another and then another.
The race has grown more desperate and more wild as the stampede neared
the sea. The weaker reindeer have been thrown down, and trampled to
death by their stronger fellows. A thousand sharp hoofs have crushed and
cut through hide and flesh and bone. Ever swifter and more terrible in
their motion, the ruthless herd has raced onward, careless of the slain,
careless of food, careless of any drink but the sharp salt water ahead
of them. And when at last the Laplanders reach the shore their deer are
once more quietly grazing, once more tame<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span> and docile, once more ready
to drag the sledge whithersoever they are guided. Once in his life the
reindeer must taste of the sea in one long, satisfying draught, and if
he is hindered he perishes. Neither man nor beast dare stand between him
and the ocean in the hundred miles of his arrow-like path.</p>

<p>Something of this longing came upon the Cossack, as he suddenly
remembered the sour taste of the kvass, to the recollection of which he
had been somehow led by a train of thought which had begun with Vjera's
love for the Count, to end abruptly in a camp kettle. For the heart of
man is much the same everywhere, and there is nothing to show that the
step from the sublime to the ridiculous is any longer in the Don country
than in any other part of the world. But between poor Johann Schmidt and
his draught of kvass there lay obstacles not encountered by the reindeer
in his race for the Arctic Ocean. There was the wife, and there were the
children, and there was the vast distance, so vast that it might have
discouraged even the fleet-footed scourer of the northern snows. Johann
Schmidt might long for his kvass, and draw in his thin, wan lips at the
thought of the taste of it, and bend his black brows and close his sharp
eyes as in a dream&mdash;it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span> was all of no use, there was no change in store
for him. He had cast his lot in the land of beer and sausages, and he
must work out his salvation and the support of his family without a
ladleful of the old familiar brew to satisfy his unreasonable caprices.</p>

<p>So, last of all those concerned in the events of the evening, Johann
Schmidt went home to bed and to rest. That power, at least, had remained
with him. Whenever he lay down he could close his eyes and be asleep,
and forget the troubles and the mean trifles of his thorny existence. In
this respect he had the advantage of the others.</p>

<p>Vjera lay down, indeed, but the attempt to sleep seemed more painful
than the accepted reality of waking. The night was the most terrible in
her remembrance, filled as it was with anxiety for the fate of the man
she so dearly loved. To her still childlike inexperience of the world,
the circumstances seemed as full of fear and danger as though the poor
Count had been put upon his trial for a murder or a robbery on an
enormous scale, instead of being merely detained because he could not
give a satisfactory account of a puppet which had been found in his
possession. In the poor girl's imagination arose visions of judges,
awful personages in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span> funereal robes and huge Hack caps, with cruel lips
and hard, steely eyes, sitting in solemn state in a gloomy hall and
dispensing death, disgrace, or long terms of prison, at the very least,
to all comers. For her, the police-station was a dungeon, and she
fancied the Count chained to a dank and slimy wall in a painful
position, chilled to the marrow by the touch of the dripping stone, his
teeth chattering, his face distorted with suffering. Of course he was in
a solitary cell, behind a heavy door, braced with clamps and bolts and
locks and studded with great dark iron nails. Without, the grim
policemen were doubtless pacing up and down with drawn swords, listening
with a murderous delight to the groans of their victim as he writhed in
his chains. In the eyes of the poor and the young, the law is a very
terrible thing, taking no account of persons, and very little of the
relative magnitude of men's misdeeds. The province of justice, as Vjera
conceived it, was to crush in its iron claws all who had the misfortune
to come within its reach. Vjera had never heard of Judge Jeffreys nor of
the Bloody Assizes, but the methods of procedure adopted by that eminent
destroyer of his kind would have seemed mild and humane compared with
what she supposed that all men, innocent or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span> guilty, had to expect after
they had once fallen into the hands of the policeman. She was not a
German girl, taught in the common school to understand something of the
methods by which society governs itself. Her early childhood had been
spent in a Polish village, far within the Russian frontier, and though
the law in Russian Poland is not exactly the irresponsible and
blood-thirsty monster depicted by young gentlemen and old maids who
traverse the country in search of horrors, yet it must be admitted by
the least prejudiced that it sometimes moves in a mysterious way,
calculated to rouse some apprehension in the minds of those who are
governed by it. And Vjera had brought with her her childish impressions,
and applied them in the present case as descriptive of the Munich
police-station. The whole subject was to her so full of horror that she
had not dared to ask Schmidt for the details of the Count's situation.
To her, a revolutionary caught in the act of undermining the Tsar's
bedroom, could not be in a worse case. She would not have believed
Schmidt, had he told her that the Count was sitting in an attitude of
calm thought upon the edge of a broad wooden bench, his hands quite free
from chains and gyves, and occupied in rolling cigarettes at regular
intervals of half an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span> hour&mdash;and this, in a clean and well-ventilated
room, lighted by a ground glass lantern. She would have supposed that
Schmidt was inventing a description of such comfort and comparative
luxury in order to calm her fears, and she would have been ten times
more afraid than before.</p>

<p>It is small wonder that she could not sleep. The Count's arrest alone
would have sufficed to keep her in an agony of wakefulness, and there
were other matters, besides that, which tormented the poor girl's brain.
She had been long accustomed to his singular madness and to hearing from
him the assurance of his returning to wealth. At first, with perfect
simplicity, she had believed every word of the story he told with such
evident certainty of its truth, and she had reproached her older
companions, as far as she dared, for their incredulity. But at last she
had herself been convinced of his madness as through the weeks, and
months, and years, the state of expectation returned on Tuesday
evenings, to be followed by the disappointments of Wednesday and by the
oblivion which ensued on Thursday morning. Vjera, like the rest, had
come to regard the regularly recurring delusion as being wholly
groundless, and not to be taken into account, except inasmuch as it
deprived them of the Count's company<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span> on Wednesdays, for on that day he
stayed at home, in his garret room, waiting for the high personages who
were to restore to him his wealth. Sometimes, indeed, when he chanced to
be very sure that they would not come for him until evening, he would
stroll through the town for an hour, looking into the shop windows and
making up his mind what he should buy; and sometimes, on such occasions,
he would visit the scene of his late labours, as he called the
tobacconist's shop on that day of the week, and would exchange a few
friendly words with his former companions. On Thursday morning he
invariably returned to his place without remark and resumed his work,
not seeming to understand any observations made about his absence or
strange conduct on the previous day.</p>

<p>So far the story he had told Vjera had always been the same. Now,
however, he had introduced a new incident in the tale, which filled poor
Vjera with dismay. He had never before spoken of his father and brother,
except as the causes of his disasters, explaining that the powerful
influence of his own friends, aided by the machinery of justice, had at
last obliged them to concede him a proportional part of the fortune.
Fischelowitz was accustomed to laugh at this statement, saying that if
the Count<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span> were only a younger son, the law would do nothing for him and
that he must continue to earn his livelihood as he could. In the course
of a long time Vjera had come to the conclusion, by comparing this
remark with the Count's statement when in his abnormal condition, that
he was indeed the son of a great noble who had turned him out of doors
for some fancied misdeed, and from whom he had in reality nothing to
expect. Such was the girl's present belief.</p>

<p>Now, however, he had suddenly declared that his father and his brother
were dead. With a woman's keenness she took alarm at this new
development. She really loved the poor man with all her heart. If this
new addition to his story were a mere invention, it was a sign that his
madness was growing upon him, and she had heard her companions discuss
their comrade often enough to know that, in their opinion, if he began
to grow worse, he would very soon be in the madhouse. It was bad enough
to go through what she suffered so often, to see the inward struggle
expressed on his face, whenever he chanced to be alone with her on a
Tuesday afternoon, to hear from his lips the same assurance of love, the
same offer of marriage, and to know that all would be forgotten and that
his manner to her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span> would change again, by Thursday, to that of a
uniform, considerate kindness. It was bad enough, for the girl loved him
and was sensitive. But it would be worse&mdash;how much worse, she dared not
think&mdash;to see him go mad before her very eyes, to see him taken away at
last from the midst of them all to the huge brick house in the outskirts
of the city beyond the Isar.</p>

<p>One more hypothesis remained. This time the story might turn out true.
She believed in his birth and in his misfortunes, and in the existence
of his father and his brother. They might indeed be dead, as he had told
her, and he would then, perhaps, be sole master in their stead&mdash;she did
not know how that would be, in Russia. But then, if it were all true, he
must go away&mdash;and her life would be over, with its loving hope and its
hopeless love.</p>

<p>It is small wonder that Vjera did not sleep that night.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
</div>

<p>Once or twice in the course of the night, the Count changed his
position, got up, stretched himself and paced the length of the room.
Dumnoff lay like a log upon his pallet, his head thrown back, his mouth
open, snoring with the strong bass vibration of a thirty-two-foot organ
pipe. The Count looked at him occasionally, but did not envy him his
power of sleep. His own reflections were in a measure more agreeable
than any dream could have been, certainly more so in his judgment than
the visions of unlimited cabbage soup, vodka, and fighting which were
doubtless delighting Dumnoff's slumbering soul.</p>

<p>As the church clocks struck one hour after another, his spirits rose. He
had, indeed, never had the least apprehension concerning his own
liberty, since he knew himself to be perfectly innocent. He only desired
to be released as soon as possible in order to repair the damage done to
his coat and collar before the earliest hour at which the messengers of
good news could be expected at his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span> house. Meanwhile he cared little
whether he spent the night on a bench in the police-station, or on one
of the rickety wooden chairs which afforded the only sitting
accommodation in his own room. He could not sleep in either case, for
his brain was too wide awake with the anticipations of the morrow, and
with the endless plans for future happiness which suggested themselves.</p>

<p>At last he was aware that the nature of the light in the room was
changing and that the white ground glass of the lantern was illuminated
otherwise than by the little flame within. The high window, as he looked
up, was like a grey figure cut out of dark paper, and the dawn was
stealing in at last.</p>

<p>"Wednesday at last!" he exclaimed softly to himself. "Wednesday at
last!" A gentle smile spread over his tired face, and made it seem less
haggard and drawn than it really was.</p>

<p>The day broke, and somewhere not far from the window, the birds all
began to sing at once, filling the room with a continuous strain of
sound, loud, clear and jubilant. The soft spring air seemed to awake, as
though it had itself been sleeping through the still night and must busy
itself now in sending the sweet breezes upon their errands to the
flowers.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span></p>

<p>"I always thought it would come in spring," thought the Count, as he
listened to the pleasant sounds, and then held one of his yellow hands
up to the window to feel the freshness that was without.</p>

<p>He wondered how long it would be before Fischelowitz would come and tell
the truth of the Gigerl's story. By his knowledge of the time of
daybreak, he guessed that it was not yet much past four o'clock, and he
doubted whether Fischelowitz would come before eight. The tobacconist
was a kind man, but a comfortable one, loving his rest and his breakfast
and his ease at all times. Moreover, as the Count knew better than any
one else, Akulina would be rejoiced to hear of the misadventure which
had befallen her enemy and would in no way hurry her husband upon his
mission of justice. She would doubtless consume an unusual amount of
time in the preparation of his coffee, she would presumably tell him
that the milkman had not appeared punctually, and would probably assert
that there were as yet no rolls to be had. The immediate consequence of
these spiteful fictions would be that Fischelowitz would dress himself
very leisurely, swallowing the smoke of several cigarettes in the
meanwhile, and that he would hardly be clothed, fed and out of the house
before eight in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span> the morning, instead of being on the way to the shop at
seven as was his usual practice.</p>

<p>But the Count was not at all disturbed by this. The persons whose coming
he expected were not of the class who pay visits at eight o'clock. It
was as pleasant to sit still and think of the glorious things in the
future, as to do anything else, until the great moment came. Here, at
least, he was undisturbed by the voices of men, unless Dumnoff's
portentous snore could be called a voice, and to this his ear had grown
accustomed.</p>

<p>He sat down again, therefore, in his old position, crossed one knee over
the other and again produced the piece of crumpled newspaper which held
his tobacco. The supply was low, but he consoled himself with the belief
that Dumnoff probably had some about him, and rolled what remained of
his own for immediate consumption.</p>

<p>He was quite right in his surmises concerning his late employer and the
latter's wife. Akulina had in the first place let her husband sleep as
long as he pleased, and had allowed a considerable time to elapse before
informing him of the events of the previous evening. As was to be
expected, the good man stated his intention of immediately procuring the
Count's liberation, and was only prevailed upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span> with difficulty to
taste his breakfast. One taste, however, convinced him of the necessity
of consuming all that was set before him, and while he was thus actively
employed Akulina entered into the consideration of the theft, recalling
all the details she could remember about the intimacy supposed to exist
between the Count and the swindler in coloured glasses, and
conscientiously showing the matter in all its aspects.</p>

<p>"One fact remains," she said, in conclusion, "he promised you upon his
honour last night that he would pay you the fifty marks to-day, and, in
my opinion, since he has been the means of your losing the Gigerl after
all, he ought to be made to pay the money."</p>

<p>"And where can he get fifty marks to pay me?" inquired Fischelowitz with
careless good-humour.</p>

<p>"Where he got the doll, I suppose," said Akulina, triumphantly
completing the vicious circle in which she caused her logic to move.</p>

<p>Fischelowitz smiled as he pushed away his cup, rose and lighted a fresh
cigarette.</p>

<p>"You are a very good housekeeper, Akulina, my love," he observed. "You
always know how the money goes."</p>

<p>"That is more than can be said for some people,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span> laughed Akulina. "But
never mind, Christian Gregorovitch, your wife is only a weak woman, but
she can take care for two, never fear!"</p>

<p>Fischelowitz was of the same opinion as he, at last, took his hat and
left the house. To him, the whole affair had a pleasant savour of humour
about it, and he was by no means so much disturbed as Johann Schmidt or
Vjera. He had lived in Munich many years and understood very well the
way in which things are managed in the good-natured Bavarian capital. A
night in the police-station in the month of May seemed by no means such
a terrible affair, certainly not a matter involving any great suffering
to any one concerned. Moreover it could not be helped, a consideration
which, when available, was a great favourite with the rotund
tobacconist. Whatever the Count had done on the previous night, he said
to himself, was done past undoing; and though, if he had found Akulina
awake when he returned from spending the evening with his friend, and if
she had then told him what had happened, he would certainly have made
haste to get the Count released&mdash;yet, since Akulina had been sound
asleep, he had necessarily gone to bed in ignorance of the story, to the
temporary inconvenience of the arrested pair.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span></p>

<p>He was not long in procuring an order for the Count's release, but
Dumnoff's case seemed to be considered as by far the graver of the two,
since he had actually been guilty of grasping the sacred, green legs of
two policemen, at the time in the execution of their duty, and of
violently turning the aforesaid policemen upside down in the public room
of an eating-house. It was, indeed, reckoned as favourable to him that
he had returned and submitted to being handcuffed without offering
further resistance, but it might have gone hard with him if Fischelowitz
had not procured the co-operation of a Munich householder and taxpayer
to bail him out until the inquiry should be made. It would have been a
serious matter for Fischelowitz to lose the work of Dumnoff in his
"celebrated manufactory" for any length of time together, since it was
all he could do to meet the increasing demands for his wares with his
present staff of workers.</p>

<p>"And how did you spend the night, Count?" he inquired as they walked
quickly down the street together. Dumnoff had made off in the opposite
direction, in search of breakfast, after which he intended to go
directly to the shop, as though nothing had happened.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span></p>

<p>"I spent it very pleasantly, thank you," answered the Count. "The fact
is that, with such an interesting day before me, I should not have slept
if I had been at home. I have so much to think of, as you may imagine,
and so many preparations to make, that the time cannot seem long with
me."</p>

<p>"I am glad of that," said Fischelowitz, serenely. "I suppose we shall
not see you to-day?"</p>

<p>"Hardly&mdash;hardly," replied the Count, as though considering whether his
engagements would allow him to look in at the shop. "You will certainly
see me this evening, at the latest," he added, as if he had suddenly
recollected something. "I have not forgotten that I am to hand you fifty
marks&mdash;I only regret that you should have lost the Gigerl, which, I
think I have heard you say, afforded you some amusement. However, the
money shall be in your hands without delay, or with as little delay as
possible. My friends will in all probability arrive by the mid-day train
and will, of course, come to me at once. An hour or so to talk over our
affairs, and I shall then have leisure to come to you for a few moments
and to settle that unfortunate affair. Not indeed, my dear Herr
Fischelowitz, that I have ever held myself responsible for the dishonest
young man who wore green spectacles. I was, indeed, a loser<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span> by him
myself, in an insignificant sum, and as he turned out to be such an
indifferent character, I do not mind acknowledging the fact. I do not
think it can harm him, if I do. No. I was not responsible for him to
you, but since your excellent wife, Frau Fischelowitz, labours under the
impression that I was, I am quite willing to accept the responsibility,
and shall therefore discharge the debt before night, as a matter of
honour."</p>

<p>"It is very kind of you," remarked the tobacconist, smiling at the
impressive manner in which the promise was made. "But of course, Count,
if anything should prevent the arrival of your friends, you will not
consider this to be an engagement."</p>

<p>"Nothing will prevent the coming of those I expect, nor, if anything
could, would such an accident prevent my fulfilling an engagement which,
since your excellent wife's remarks last night, I do consider binding
upon my honour. And now, Herr Fischelowitz, with my best thanks for your
intervention this morning, I will leave you. After the vicissitudes to
which I have been exposed during the last twelve hours, my appearance is
not what I could wish it to be. I have the pleasure to wish you a very
good morning."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p>

<p>Shaking his companion heartily by the hand, the Count bowed civilly and
turned into an unfrequented street. Fischelowitz looked after him a few
seconds, as though expecting that he would turn back and say something
more, and then walked briskly in the direction of his shop.</p>

<p>He found Akulina standing at the door which led into the workroom, in
such a position as to be able to serve a customer should any chance to
enter, and yet so placed as to see the greater part of her audience. For
she was holding forth volubly in her thick, strong voice, giving her
very decided opinion about the events of the previous evening, the
Count, considered in the first place as a specimen of the human race,
and secondly, as in relation to his acts. Her hearers were poor Vjera,
her insignificant companion and the Cossack who listened, so to say,
without enthusiasm, unless the occasional foolish giggle of the younger
girl was to be taken for the expression of applause.</p>

<p>"I am thoroughly sick of his crazy ways," she was saying, "and if he
were not really such a good workman we should have turned him out long
ago. But he really does make cigarettes very well, and with the new shop
about to be opened, and the demand there is already, it is all we can do
to keep<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span> people satisfied. Not but what my husband has been talking
lately of getting a new workman from Vilna, and if he turns out to be
all that we expect, why the Count may go about his business and we shall
be left in peace at last. Indeed it is high time. My poor nerves will
not stand many more such scenes as last night, and as for my poor
husband, I believe he has lost as much money through the Count and his
friends as he has paid to him for work, and if you turn that into
figures it makes the cigarettes he rolls worth six marks a thousand
instead of three, which is more than any pocket can stand, while there
are children to be fed at home. And if you have anything to say to that,
little husband, why just say it!"</p>

<p>Fischelowitz had entered the shop and the last words were addressed to
him.</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing, nothing," he answered, beginning to bustle cheerily about
the place, setting a box straight here, removing an empty one there,
opening the till and counting the small change, and, generally, doing
all those things which he was accustomed to do when he appeared in the
morning.</p>

<p>Poor Vjera looked paler and more waxen than ever in her life before, so
pale indeed was she that the total absence of colour lent a sort of
refinement<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span> to her plain features, not often found even in really
beautiful faces. She had suffered intensely and was suffering still.
From the first words that Akulina had spoken she had understood that the
Count had been in the station-house all night, and she found herself
reviewing all the hideous visions of his cruel treatment which she had
conjured up since the previous evening. Akulina of course hastened to
say that Fischelowitz had lost no time in having the poor man set at
liberty, and this at least was a relief to Vjera's great anxiety. But
she wanted to hear far more than Akulina could or would tell, she longed
to know whether he had really suffered as she fancied he had, and how he
looked after spending in a prison the night that had seemed so long to
her. She would have given anything to overwhelm the tobacconist with
questions, to ask for a minute description of the Count's appearance, to
express her past terrors to some one and to have some one tell her that
they had been groundless.</p>

<p>But she dared not open her lips to speak of the matters which filled her
thoughts. She was so wretchedly nervous that she felt as though the
tears would break out at the sound of her own voice, and at the same
time she was disturbed by the consciousness<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span> that Johann Schmidt's eyes
watched her closely from the corner in which he was steadily wielding
his swivel knife. It had been almost natural to tell him of her love in
the darkness of the streets, in the mad anxiety for the loved one's
safety, in the weariness and the hopelessness of the night hours. But
now, sitting at her little table, at her daily work, with all the
trivial objects that belonged to it recalling her to the reality of
things, she realised that her day-dreams were no longer her secret, and
she was ashamed that any one should guess the current of her thoughts.
It was hard for her to understand how she could have thus taken the
Cossack into her confidence, and she would have made almost any
sacrifice to take back the confession. Good he was, and honest, and
kind-hearted, but she was ashamed of what she had done. It seemed to her
that, besides giving up to another the knowledge of her heart, she had
also done something against the dignity of him she loved. She herself
felt no superiority over Johann Schmidt; they were equals in every way.
But she did feel, and strongly, that the Cossack was not the equal of
the Count, and she reproached herself with having made a confidant of
one beneath her idol in station and refinement. This feeling sprang from
such a multiplicity of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span> sources, as almost to defy explanation. There
was, at the bottom of it, the strange, unreasoning notion of the
superiority of one class over another by right of blood, from which no
race seems to be wholly exempt, and which has produced such surprising
results in the world. Poor Vjera had been brought up in one of those
countries where that tradition is still strongest. The mere sound of the
word "Count" evoked a body of impressions so firmly rooted, so deeply
ingrained, as necessarily to influence her judgment. The outward manner
of the man did the rest, his dignity under all circumstances, his
uncomplaining patience, his unquestioning generosity, his quiet courtesy
to every one. There was something in every word he spoke, in his every
action, which distinguished him from his companions. They themselves
felt it. He was sometimes ridiculous, poor man, and they laughed
together over his carefully chosen language, over the grand sweep of his
bow and his punctilious attention to the smallest promise or shadow of a
promise. These things amused them, but at the same time they felt that
he could never be what they were, and that those manners and speeches of
his, which, if they had imitated them, would have seemed in themselves
so many forms of vulgarity,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span> were somehow not vulgar in him. Vjera, as
she loved him, felt all this far more keenly than the others. And
besides, to add to her embarrassment at present, there was the girl's
maidenly shyness and timidity. Since she had told Johann Schmidt her
secret, she felt as though all eyes were upon her, and as though every
one were about to turn upon her with those jesting questions which
coarse natures regard as expressions of sympathy where love is
concerned. And yet no one spoke to her, nor disturbed her. There was
only the disquieting consciousness of the Cossack's curious scrutiny to
remind her that all things were not as they had been yesterday.</p>

<p>The hours of the morning seemed endless. On all other days, Vjera was
accustomed to see the Count's quiet face opposite to her, and when she
was most weary of her monotonous toil, a glance at him gave her fresh
courage, and turned the currents of her thoughts into a channel not
always smooth indeed, but long familiar and never wearisome to follow.
The stream emptied, it is true, into the dead sea of doubt, and each
time, as she ended the journey of her fancy, she felt the cruel chill of
the conclusion, as though she had in reality fallen into a deep, dark
water; but she was always able<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span> to renew the voyage, to return to the
fountain-head of love, enjoying at least the pleasant, smooth reaches of
the river, that lay between the racing rapids and the tumbling falls.</p>

<p>But to-day there was no one at the little table opposite, and Vjera's
reflections would not be guided in their familiar course. Her heart
yearned for the lonely man who, on that day, sat in the solitude of his
poor chamber confidently expecting the messengers of good tidings who
never came. She wondered what expression was on his face, as he watched
the door and listened for the fall of feet upon the stairs. She knew,
for she knew his nature, that he had carefully dressed himself in what
he had that was best, in order to receive decently the long-expected
visit; she fancied that he would move thoughtfully about the narrow
room, trying to give it a feebly festive look in accordance with his own
inward happiness. He would forget to eat, as he sat there, hearing the
hours chime one after another, seeing the sun rise higher and higher
until noon and watching the lengthening shadows of the chimneys on the
roofs as day declined. More than all, she wondered what that dreadful
moment could be like when, each week, he gave up hope at last, and saw
that it had all been a dream. She<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span> had seen him more than once, towards
the evening of the regularly recurring day, still confidently expecting
the coming of his friends, explaining that they must come by the last
train, and hastening away in order to be ready to receive them.
Somewhere between the Wednesday evening and the Thursday morning there
must be an hour, of which she hardly dared to think, in which all was
made clear to him, or in which a veil descended over all, shutting out
in merciful obscurity the brilliant vision and the bitter
disappointment. If she could only be with him at that moment, she
thought, she might comfort him, she might make his sufferings more easy
to bear, and at the idea the tears that were so near rose nearer still
to the flowing, kept back only by shame of being seen.</p>

<p>It was a terrible day, and everything jarred upon the poor girl's
nature, from Akulina's thick, strong voice, continually discussing the
question of marks and pennies, with occasional allusions to late events,
to the disagreeable, scratching, paring sound of the Cossack's heavy
knife as it cut its way through the great packages of leaves. The
mid-day hour afforded no relief, for the pressure of work was great and
each of the workers had brought a little food to be eaten in haste and
almost without a change of position.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span> For the work was paid for in
proportion to its quantity, and the poor people were glad enough when
there was so much to do, since there was then just so much more to be
earned. There were times when the demand was slack and when Fischelowitz
would not keep his people at their tables for more than two or three
hours in a day. They might occupy the rest of their time as they could,
and earn something in other ways, if they were able. When those hard
times came poor Vjera picked up a little sewing, paid for at starvation
rates, Johann Schmidt turned his hand to the repairing of furs, in which
he had some skill, and which is an art in itself, and Dumnoff varied his
existence by exercising great economy in the matter of food without
making a similar reduction in the allowance of his drink. Under ordinary
circumstances Vjera would have rejoiced at the quantity of work to be
done, and as it was, her mental suffering did not make her fingers
awkward or less nervously eager in the perpetual rolling of the little
pieces of paper round the glass tube. Even acute physical pain is often
powerless to affect the mechanical skill of a hand trained for many
years to repeat the same little operation thousands of times in a day
with unvarying perfection. Vjera worked as well and as quickly as ever,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
though the hours seemed so endlessly long as to make her wonder why she
did not turn out more work than usual. From time to time the two men
exchanged more or less personal observations after their manner.</p>

<p>"It seems to me that you work better than usual," remarked the Cossack,
looking at Dumnoff.</p>

<p>"I feel better," laughed the latter. "I feel as though I had been having
a holiday and a country dance."</p>

<p>"For the sake of your health, you ought to have a little excitement now
and then," continued Schmidt. "It is hard for a man of your constitution
to be shut up day after day as you are here. A little bear-fight now and
then would do you almost as much good as an extra bottle of brandy,
besides being cheaper."</p>

<p>"Yes." Dumnoff yawned, displaying all his ferocious white teeth to the
assembled company. "That is true&mdash;and then, those green cloth policemen
look so funny when one upsets them. I wish I had a few here."</p>

<p>"You have not heard the last of your merry-making yet," said
Fischelowitz, who was standing in the doorway. "If I had not got you out
this morning you would still be in the police-station."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span></p>

<p>"There is something in that," observed Schmidt. "If he were not out, he
would still be in."</p>

<p>"Well, if I were, I should still be asleep," said Dumnoff. "That would
not be so bad, after all."</p>

<p>"You may be there again before long," suggested Fischelowitz. "You know
there is to be an inquiry. I only hope you will do plenty of work before
they lock you up for a fortnight."</p>

<p>"I suppose they will let me work in prison," answered Dumnoff,
indifferently. "They do in some places."</p>

<p>Vjera, whose ideas of prisons have been already explained at length, was
so much surprised that she at last opened her lips.</p>

<p>"Have you ever been in prison?" she asked in a wondering tone.</p>

<p>"Several times," replied the other, without looking up. "But always," he
added, as though suddenly anxious for his reputation, "always for that
sort of thing&mdash;for upsetting somebody who did not want to be upset. It
is a curious thing&mdash;I always do it in the same way, and they always
tumble down. One would think people would learn&mdash;" he paused as though
considering a profound problem.</p>

<p>"Perhaps they are not always the same people," remarked the Cossack.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span></p>

<p>"That is true. That may have something to do with it." The ex-coachman
relapsed into silence.</p>

<p>"But, is it not very dreadful&mdash;in prison?" asked Vjera rather timidly,
after a short pause.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;if one can sleep well, the time passes very pleasantly. Of course,
one is not always as comfortable as we were last night. That is not to
be expected."</p>

<p>"Comfortable!" exclaimed the girl in surprise.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;we had a nice room with a good light, and there happened to be
nobody else in for the night. It was dry and clean and well
furnished&mdash;rather hard beds, I believe, though I scarcely noticed them.
We smoked and talked some time and then I went to sleep. Oh, yes&mdash;I
passed a very pleasant evening, and a comfortable night."</p>

<p>"But I thought&mdash;" Vjera hesitated, as though fearing that she was going
to say something foolish. "I thought that prisoners always had chains,"
she said, at last.</p>

<p>Everybody laughed loudly at this remark and the poor girl felt very much
ashamed of herself, though the question had seemed so natural and had
been in her mind a long time. It was an immense relief, however, to know
that things had not been so bad as she had imagined, and Dumnoff's
description of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span> the place of his confinement was certainly reassuring.</p>

<p>As the endless day wore on, she began to glance anxiously towards the
door, straining her ears for a familiar footstep in the outer shop. As
has been said, the Count sometimes looked in on Wednesdays, when his
calculations had convinced him that his friends, not having arrived by
one train, could not be expected for several hours. But to-day he did
not come, to-day when Vjera would have given heaven and earth for a
sight of him. Never, in her short life, had she realised how slowly the
hours could limp along from sunrise to noon, from noon to sunset, never
had the little spot of sunlight which appeared in the back-shop on fine
afternoons taken so long to crawl its diagonal course from the left
front-leg of Dumnoff's table, where it made its appearance, to the
right-hand corner of her own, at which point it suddenly went out and
was seen no more, being probably intercepted by some fixed object
outside.</p>

<p>Time is the measure of most unhapppiness, for it is in sorrow and
anxiety that we are most keenly conscious of it, and are oppressed by
its leaden weight. When we are absorbed in work, in study, in the
production of anything upon which all our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span> faculties are concentrated,
we say that the time passes quickly. When we are happy we know nothing
of time nor of its movement, only, long afterwards, we look back, and we
say, "How short the hours seemed then!"</p>

<p>Vjera toiled on and on, watching the creeping sunshine on the floor,
glancing at the ever-increasing heap of cut leaves that fell from the
Cossack's cutting-block, noting the slow rise in the pile of paper
shells before her and comparing it with that produced by the girl at her
elbow, longing for the moment when she would see the freshly-made
cigarettes just below the inner edge of Dumnoff's basket, taking account
of every little thing by which to persuade herself that the day was
declining and the evening at hand.</p>

<p>Her life was sad and monotonous enough at the best of times. It seemed
as though the accidents of the night had made it by contrast ten times
more sad and monotonous and hopeless than before.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>
</div>

<p>The Count, as Vjera supposed, had dressed himself with even greater care
than usual in anticipation of the official visit, and while she was
working through the never-ending hours of her weary day, he was calmly
seated upon a chair by the open window in his little room, one leg
crossed over the other, one hand thrust into the bosom of his coat and
the other extended idly upon the table by his side. His features
expressed the perfect calm and satisfaction of a man who knows that
something very pleasant is about to happen, who has prepared himself for
it, and who sits in the midst of his swept and garnished dwelling in an
attitude of pleased expectancy.</p>

<p>The Count's face was tired, indeed, and there were dark circles under
his sunken grey eyes, brought there by loss of sleep as much as by an
habitual facility for forgetting to eat and drink. But in the eyes
themselves there was a bright, unusual light, as though some brilliant
spectacle were reflected in them out of the immediate future.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span> There was
colour, too, in his lean cheeks, a slight flush like that which comes
into certain dark faces with the anticipation of any keen pleasure. As
he sat in his chair, he looked constantly at the door of the room, as
though expecting it to open at any moment. From time to time, voices and
footsteps were heard on the stairs, far below. When any of these sounds
reached him, the Count rose gravely from his seat, and stood in the
middle of the room, slowly rubbing his hands together, listening again,
moving a step to the one side or the other and back again, in the
mechanical manner of a person to whom a visitor has been announced and
who expects to see him appear almost immediately. But the footsteps
echoed and died away and the voices were still again. The Count stood
still a few moments when this happened, satisfying himself that he had
been mistaken, and then, shaking his head and once more passing his
hands round each other, he resumed his seat and his former attitude. He
listened also for the chiming of the hours, and when he was sure that an
hour had passed since the arrival of his imaginary express train, he
rose again, looked out of the window, watched the wheeling of the house
swallows, and assumed an air of momentary indifference. The next
ringing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span> of the clock bells revived the illusion. Another train was
doubtless just running in to the station, and in a quarter of an hour
his friends might be with him. There was no time to be lost. The flush
returned to his cheeks as he hastily combed his smooth hair for the
twentieth time, examining his appearance minutely in the dingy, spotted
mirror, brushing his clothes&mdash;far too well brushed these many years&mdash;and
lastly making sure that there was no weak point in the adjustment of his
false collar. He made another turn of inspection round his little room,
feeling sure that there was just time to see that all was right and in
order, but already beginning to listen for a noise of approaching people
on the stairs. Once more he straightened and arranged the patched
coverlet of Turkey red cotton upon the bed, so that it should hide the
pillows and the sheets; once more he adjusted the clean towel neatly
upon the wooden peg over the washing-stand, discreetly concealing the
one he had used in the drawer of the table; for the last time he made
sure that the chair which had the broken leg was in such close and
perfect contact with the wall as to make it safely serviceable if not
rashly removed into a wider sphere of action. Then, as he passed the
chest of drawers, he gave a final touch to the half-dozen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span> ragged-edged
books which composed his library&mdash;three volumes of Puschkin, of three
different editions, Ivan Kryloff's <i>Poems and Fables</i>, Gogol's <i>Terrible
Revenge</i>, Tolstoi's <i>How People Live</i>, and two or three more, including
Koltsoff, the shepherd poet, and an ancient guide to the city of
Kiew&mdash;as heterogeneous a collection of works as could be imagined, yet
all notable in their way, except, indeed, the guide-book, for beauty,
power, or touching truth.</p>

<p>And when he had touched and straightened everything in the room, he
returned to his seat, calmly expectant as ever, to wait for the
footsteps on the stairs, to rise and rub his hands, if the sound reached
him, to shake his head gravely if he were again disappointed, in short
to go through the same little round of performance as before until some
chiming clock suggested to his imagination that the train had come and
brought no one, and that he might enjoy an interval of distraction in
looking out of the window until the next one arrived. The Count must
have had a very exaggerated idea of the facility of communication
between Munich and Russia, for he assuredly stood waiting for his
friends, combed, brushed, and altogether at his best, more than twenty
times between the morning<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span> and the evening. As the day declined, indeed,
his imaginary railway station must have presented a scene of dangerous
confusion, for his international express trains seemed to come in
quicker and quicker succession, until he barely had time to look out of
the window before it became necessary to comb his hair again in order to
be ready for the next possible arrival. At last he walked perpetually on
a monotonous beat from the window to the mirror, from the mirror to the
door, and from the door to the mirror again.</p>

<p>Suddenly he stopped and tapped his forehead with his hand. The sun was
setting and the last of his level rays shot over the sea of roofs and
the forest of chimneys and entered the little room in a broad red
stream, illuminating the lean, nervous figure as it stood still in the
ruddy light.</p>

<p>"Good Heavens!" exclaimed the Count, in a tone of great anxiety, "I have
forgotten Fischelowitz and his money."</p>

<p>There was a considerable break in the continuity of the imaginary
time-table, for he stood still a long time, in deep thought. He was
arguing the case in his mind. What he had promised was, to consider the
fifty marks as a debt of honour. Now a debt of honour must be paid
within twenty-four hours. No<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span> doubt, thought the Count, it would not be
altogether impossible to consider the twenty-four hours as extending
from midnight to midnight. The Russians have an expression which means a
day and a night together&mdash;they call that space of time the sutki, and it
is a more or less elastic term, as we say "from day to day," "from one
evening to another." Rooms in Russian hotels are let by the sutki,
railway tickets are valid for one or more sutki, and the Count might
have chosen to consider that his sutki extended from the time when he
had spoken to Fischelowitz until twelve o'clock on the following night.
But he had no means of knowing exactly what the time had been when he
had been in the shop, and his punctilious ideas of honour drove him to
under-estimate the number of hours still at his disposal. Moreover, and
this last consideration determined his action, if he brought the money
too late it was to be feared that Fischelowitz would have shut up the
shop, after which there would be no certainty of finding him. The Count
wished to make the restitution of the money in Akulina's presence, but
he was also determined to give the fifty marks directly to the
tobacconist.</p>

<p>He saw that the sun was going down, and that there was no time to be
lost. It occurred to him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span> at the same instant that if he was to pay the
debt at all, he must find money for that purpose, and although, in his
own belief, he was to be master of a large fortune in the course of the
evening, no scheme for raising so considerable a sum as fifty marks
presented itself to his imagination. Poor as he was, he was far more
used to lending than to borrowing, and more accustomed to giving than to
either. He regretted, now, that he had bound himself to pay the debt
to-day. It would have been so easy to name the next day but one. But who
could have foreseen that his friends would miss that particular train
and only arrive late in the evening?</p>

<p>He paced his room in growing anxiety, his trouble increasing in exact
proportion with the decrease of the daylight.</p>

<p>"Fifty marks!" he exclaimed, in dismay, as he realised more completely
the dilemma in which he was placed. "Fifty marks! It is an enormous sum
to find at a moment's notice. If they had only telegraphed me a credit
at once, I could have got it from a bank&mdash;a bank&mdash;yes&mdash;but they do not
know me. That is it. They do not know me. And then, it is late."</p>

<p>The drops of perspiration stood on his pale forehead as he began to walk
again. He glanced at his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span> possessions and turned from the contemplation
of them in renewed despair. Many a time, before, he had sought among his
very few belongings for some object upon which a pawnbroker might
advance five marks, and he had sought in vain. The furniture of the room
was not his, and beyond the furniture the room contained little enough.
He had parted long ago with an old silver watch, of which the chain had
even sooner found its way to the lender's. A long-cherished ring had
disappeared last winter, by an odd coincidence, at the very time when
Johann Schmidt's oldest child was lying ill with diphtheria. As for
clothing, he had nothing to offer. The secrets of his outward appearance
were known to him alone, but they were of a nature to discourage the
hope of raising money on coat or trousers. A few well-thumbed volumes of
Russian authors could not be expected to find a brilliant sale in Munich
at a moment's notice. He looked about, and he saw that there was
nothing, and he turned very pale.</p>

<p>"And yet, before midnight, it must be paid," he said. Then his face
brightened again. "Before midnight&mdash;but they will be here before then,
of course. Perhaps I may borrow the money for a few hours."</p>

<p>But in order to do this, or to attempt it, he must<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span> go out. What if his
friends arrived at the moment when he was out of the house?</p>

<p>"No," he said, consulting his imaginary time-table, "there is no train
now, for a couple of hours, at least."</p>

<p>He took up his hat and turned to go. It struck him, however, that to
provide against all possible accidents it would be as well to leave some
written word upon his table, and he took up a sheet of writing paper and
a pen. It was remarkable that there was a good supply of the former on
the table, and that the inkstand contained ink in a fluid state, as
though the Count were in the habit of using it daily. He wrote rapidly,
in Russian.</p>

<p>"This line is to inform you that Count Skariatine is momentarily absent
from his lodging on a matter of urgent importance, connected with a
personal engagement. He will return as soon as possible and requests
that you will have the goodness to wait, if you should happen to arrive
while he is out."</p>

<p>He set the piece of notepaper upright, in a prominent position upon the
table, and exactly opposite to the door. He did not indeed recollect
that in the course of half an hour the room would be quite dark, and he
was quite satisfied that he had taken every<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span> reasonable precaution
against missing his visitors altogether. Once more he seized his hat,
and a moment later he was descending the long flights of stairs towards
the street. As he went, the magnitude of the sum of money he needed
appalled him, and by the time he stepped out upon the pavement into the
fresh evening air, he was in a state of excitement and anxiety which
bordered on distraction. His brain refused to act any longer, and he was
utterly incapable of thinking consecutively of anything, still less of
solving a problem so apparently incapable of solution as was involved in
the question of finding fifty marks at an hour's notice. It was
practically of little use to repeat the words "Fifty marks" incessantly
and in an audible voice, to the great surprise of the few pedestrians he
met. It was far from likely that any of them would consider themselves
called upon to stop in their walk and to produce two large gold pieces
and a small one, for the benefit of an odd-looking stranger. And yet, as
he hurried along the street, the poor Count had not the least idea where
he was going, and if he should chance to reach any definite destination
in his erratic course he would certainly be much puzzled to decide what
he was to do upon his arrival. The one thing which remained clearly
defined in his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span> shaken intelligence was that he must pay to Fischelowitz
the money promised within the limit of time agreed upon, or be disgraced
for ever in his own eyes, as well as in the estimation of the world at
large. The latter catastrophe would be bad enough, but nothing short of
self-destruction could follow upon his condemnation of himself.</p>

<p>A special Providence is said to watch over the movements of madmen,
sleep-walkers and drunkards. Those who find difficulty in believing in
the direct intervention of Heaven in very trivial matters of everyday
life, are satisfied to put a construction of less tremendous import upon
the facts in cases concerning the preservation of their irresponsible
brethren. A great deal may be accounted for by considering what are the
instincts of the body when momentarily liberated from the directing
guidance of the mind. It has been already noticed in the course of this
story that, when the Count did not know where he was going, he was
generally making the best of his way to the establishment in which so
much of his time was passed. This is exactly what took place on the
present occasion. Conscious only of his debt, and not knowing where to
find money with which to pay it, he was unwittingly hurrying towards the
very place in which the payment was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span> to be made, and, within a quarter
of an hour of his leaving his lodging, he found himself standing on the
pavement, over against the tobacconist's shop, stupidly gazing at the
glass door, the well-known sign and the familiar, dilapidated chalet of
cigarettes which held a prominent place in the show window. No longer
ago than yesterday afternoon the little Swiss cottage had been flanked
by the Wiener Gigerl, whose smart red coat and insolent face had been
the cause of so much disaster and anxiety during the past twenty-four
hours. The very fact that the doll was no longer there, in its
accustomed place, served to remind the Count of his rash promise to pay
the money and dangerously increased the excitement which already
possessed him. He wiped the cold drops from his brow and leaned for a
moment against the brick wall behind him. He was dizzy, confused and
tired.</p>

<p>The tormenting thought that was driving him recalled his failing
consciousness of outer things. He straightened himself again and made a
step forward, as though he would cross the street, but paused again
before his foot had left the pavement. Then he asked of his senses how
he had got to the place where he stood. He did not remember traversing
the familiar highways and byways by which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span> he was accustomed daily to
make his way from his lodging to the shop. Every object on the way had
long been so well known to him as to cause a permanent impression in his
brain, which was distinctly visible to him whenever he thought of the
walk in any way, whether he had just been over the ground or not. He
could not now account to himself for his being so near Fischelowitz's
shop, and he found it impossible to decide whether he had come thither
by his usual route or not. It was still harder to explain the reason for
his coming, since the fifty marks were no nearer to his hand than
before, and without them it was useless to think of entering. As he
stood there, hesitating and trying to grasp the situation more clearly,
it grew, on the contrary, more and more confused. At the same time the
bells of a neighbouring church struck the hour, and the clanging tone
revived in his mind the other impression, which had possessed it all
day, the impression that his friends were at that moment arriving at the
railway station. The confusion in his thoughts became intolerable, and
he covered his eyes with one hand, steadying himself by pressing the
other against the wall.</p>

<p>He did not know how long he had stood thus, when an anxious voice
recalled him to outer things&mdash;a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span> voice in which love, sympathy,
tenderness and anxiety for him had taken possession of the weak tones
and lent them a passing thrill of touching music.</p>

<p>"In Heaven's name&mdash;what is it? Speak to me&mdash;I am Vjera&mdash;here, beside
you."</p>

<p>He looked up suddenly, and seemed to recover his self-possession.</p>

<p>"You came just in time, Vjera&mdash;God bless you. I&mdash;" he hesitated. "I
think&mdash;I must have been a little dizzy with the heat. It is a warm
evening&mdash;a very warm evening."</p>

<p>He pressed an old silk pocket-handkerchief to his moist brow, the
pocket-handkerchief which he always had about him, freshly ironed and
smoothly folded, on the day when he expected his friends. Vjera, her
face pale with distress, passed her arm through his and made as though
she would walk with him down the gentle slope of the street, which leads
in the direction of the older city. He suffered himself to be led a few
steps in silence.</p>

<p>"Where are you going, Vjera?" he asked, stopping again and looking into
her face.</p>

<p>"Wherever you like," she said, trying to speak cheerfully. She saw that
something terrible was happening, and it was only by a desperate effort<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
that she controlled the violent hysterical emotion that rose like a
great lump in her throat.</p>

<p>"Ah, that is it, Vjera," he answered. "That is it. Where shall I go,
child?" Then he laughed nervously. "The fact is," he continued, "that I
am in a very absurd position. I do not at all know what to do."</p>

<p>Perhaps he had tried to give himself courage by the attempt to laugh,
but, in that case, he had failed for the present. In spite of his words
his despair was evident. His usually erect carriage was gone. His head
sank wearily forward, his shoulders rounded themselves as though under a
burden, his feet dragged a little as he tried to walk on again, and he
leaned heavily on the young girl's arm.</p>

<p>"What is it?" she asked. "Tell me&mdash;perhaps I can help you&mdash;I mean&mdash;I beg
your pardon," she added, humbly, "perhaps it would help you to speak of
it. That sometimes makes things seem clearer just when they have been
most confused."</p>

<p>"Perhaps so, Vjera, perhaps so. You are a very good girl, and you came
just in time. I love you, Vjera&mdash;do not forget that I love you." His
voice was by turns sharp and suddenly low and monotonous, like that of a
man talking in sleep. Altogether his manner was so strange that poor
Vjera feared the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span> very worst. The extremity of her anxiety kept her from
losing her self-possession. For the first time in her life she felt that
she was the stronger of the two, and that if he was to be saved it must
be by her efforts rather than by anything he was now able to do for
himself. She loved him, mad or sane, with an admiration and a devotion
which took no account of his intellectual state except to grieve over it
for his own sake. The belief that in this crisis she might be of use to
him, strongly conquered the rising hysterical passion, and drove the
tears so far from her eyes that she wondered vaguely why she had been so
near to shedding them a few moments sooner. She pressed his arm with her
hand.</p>

<p>"And I, too, I love you, with all my heart and soul," she said. "And if
you will tell me what has happened, I will do what I can&mdash;if it were my
life that were needed. I know I can help you, for God will help me."</p>

<p>He raised his head a little and again stood still, gazing into her eyes
with an odd sort of childish wonder.</p>

<p>"What makes you so strong, Vjera? You used to be a weak little thing."</p>

<p>"Love," she answered.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span></p>

<p>It was strange to see such a man, outwardly lean, tough-looking, well
put together and active, though not, indeed, powerful, looking at the
poor white-faced girl and asking the secret of her strength, as though
he envied it. But at that moment, the natural situation was reversed.
His eyes were lustreless, tired, without energy. Hers were suddenly
bright and flashing with determination, and with the expression of her
new-found will. Vjera felt that all at once a change had come over her,
the weak strings of her heart grew strong, the dreamy hopelessness of
her thoughts fell away, leaving one clearly defined resolution in its
place. The man she loved was going mad, and she would save him, cost
what it might.</p>

<p>That Faith, no larger than the tiniest mustard seed, but able to toss
the mountains, as pebbles, from their foundations into the sea, is the
determination to do the thing chosen to be done or to die&mdash;literally, to
die&mdash;in the trying to do it. Death is farther from most of us than we
fancy, and if we would but risk all, to win or lose all, we could almost
always do the deed which looks so grimly impossible. Those who have
faced great physical dangers, or who have been matched by fate against
overwhelming odds of anxiety and trouble, alone<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span> know what great things
are done when men stand at bay and face the world, and fate, and life,
and death and misfortune, all banded together against them, and say in
their hearts, "We will win this fight or die." Then, at that word, when
it is spoken earnestly, in sincerity and truth, the iron will rises up
and takes possession of the feeble body, the doubting soul shakes off
its hesitating weakness, is drawn back upon itself like a strong bow
bent double, is compressed and full of a terrible latent power, like the
handful of deadly explosive which, buried in the bosom of the rock, will
presently shake the mighty cliff to its roots, as no thunderbolt could
shake it.</p>

<p>Vjera had made up her mind that she would save the man she loved from
the destruction which was coming upon him. How he was to be saved, she
knew not, but then and there, on the pavement of the commonplace Munich
street, she made her stand and faced the odds, as bravely as ever
soldier faced the enemy's triumphant charge, though she was only a
forlorn little Polish shell-maker, without much health or strength, and
having very little understanding of the danger beyond that which was
given to her by her love.</p>

<p>She fixed her eyes upon the Count's face as though she would have him
obey her.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span></p>

<p>"I will help you, and make everything right," she said. "But you must
tell me what the trouble is."</p>

<p>"But how can you help me, child?" he asked, beginning to grow calmer
under her clear gaze. "It is such a very complicated case," he
continued, falling back gradually into his own natural manner. "You see,
my friends have probably arrived by this train, and yet I cannot go home
until I have set this other matter right with Fischelowitz. It is true,
I have left a word written for them on my table, and perhaps they are
there now, waiting for me, and if I went home I could have the money at
once. But then&mdash;it may be too late before I get here again&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What money?" asked Vjera, anxious to get at the truth without delay.</p>

<p>"Oh, it is an absurd thing," he answered, growing nervous again. "Quite
absurd&mdash;and yet, it is fifty marks&mdash;and until they come, I do not see
what to do. Fifty marks&mdash;to-day it seems so much, and to-morrow it will
seem so little!" He made a poor attempt to smile, but his voice
trembled.</p>

<p>"But these fifty marks&mdash;what do you need them for to-night?" Vjera
asked, not understanding at all. "Will not to-morrow do as well?"</p>

<p>"No, no!" he cried in renewed anxiety. "It<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span> must be to-night, now, this
very hour. If I do not pay the money, I am ruined, Vjera, disgraced for
ever. It is a debt of honour&mdash;you do not understand what that means,
child, nor how terrible it is for a man not to pay before the day is
over&mdash;ah, if it were not a debt of honour!&mdash;but there is no time to be
lost. It is almost dark already. Go home, dear Vjera, go home. I cannot
go with you to-night, for I must find this money. Good-night&mdash;and then
to-morrow&mdash;I have not forgotten, and you must not forget&mdash;but there is
no time now&mdash;good-night!"</p>

<p>He suddenly broke away from her side and began walking quickly in the
opposite direction, his head bent down, his arms swinging by his side.
She ran after him and again took his arm, and looked into his face.</p>

<p>"You must not go away like this," she said, so firmly and with so much
authority that he stood still. "You have only half explained the trouble
to me, but I can help you. A debt of honour, you say&mdash;what will happen
if you do not pay it?"</p>

<p>"I must die," answered the Count. "I could never respect myself again."</p>

<p>"You have borrowed this money of Fischelowitz and promised to pay it
to-day? Is that it? Tell me."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span></p>

<p>"No&mdash;I never borrowed it. No, no&mdash;it was that villain, last winter, who
gave him the Gigerl&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And Fischelowitz expects you to pay that!" cried Vjera, indignantly.
"It is impossible."</p>

<p>"When I took the Gigerl away last night I promised to bring the fifty
marks by to-night. I gave my word, my word as a gentleman, Vjera, which
I cannot break&mdash;my word, as a gentleman," he repeated with something of
his old dignity.</p>

<p>"It is monstrous that Fischelowitz should have taken such a promise,"
said Vjera.</p>

<p>"That does not alter the obligation," answered the Count proudly.
"Besides, I gave it of my own accord. I did not wait for him to ask it,
after his wife accused me of being the means of his losing the money."</p>

<p>"Oh, how could she be so heartless!" Vjera exclaimed.</p>

<p>"What was the use of telling you? I did not mean to. Good-night, Vjera
dear&mdash;I must be quick." He tried to leave her, but she held him fast.</p>

<p>"I will get you the money at once," she said desperately and without the
least hesitation. He started, in the utmost astonishment, staring at her
as though he fancied that she had lost her senses.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span></p>

<p>"You! Why, Vjera, how can you imagine that I would take it from you, or
how do you think it would be possible for you to find it? You are mad,
my dear child, quite mad!"</p>

<p>In spite of everything, the tears broke from her eyes at the words which
meant so much to her and which seemed to mean so little to him. But she
brushed them bravely away.</p>

<p>"You say you love me&mdash;you know that I love you. Do you trust me? Do you
believe in me? And if you do, why then believe that I will do what I
say. And as for taking the fifty marks from me&mdash;will not your friends be
here to-night, as you say, and will you not be able to give it all back
very soon? Only wait here&mdash;or no, go into the shop and talk to
Fischelowitz&mdash;I will bring it to you in less than an hour, I promise you
that I will&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But how? Oh, Vjera&mdash;I am in such trouble that I could almost bring
myself to borrow it of you if you could lend it&mdash;I despise myself, but
it is growing so late, and it will only be until to-morrow, only for a
few hours perhaps. If you will wait to-night I may bring it to you
before bedtime. But&mdash;are you sure, Vjera? Have you really got it? If I
should wait here&mdash;and you should not find it&mdash;and my word should be
broken&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span></p>

<p>"For your word I give you mine. You shall have it in an hour." She tried
to throw so much certainty into her tone as might persuade him, and she
succeeded. "Where will you wait for me? In the shop?" she asked.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;not there. In the Caf&eacute; here&mdash;I am tired&mdash;I will sit down and drink
a cup of coffee. I think I have a little money&mdash;enough for that." He
smiled faintly as he felt in his pockets. Then his face fell. On the
previous evening, when they had led him away from the eating-house, he
had carelessly given all he had&mdash;a mark and two pennies&mdash;to pay for his
supper, throwing it to the fat hostess without any reckoning, as he went
out. "Never mind," he said, after the fruitless search. "I will wait
outside."</p>

<p>But Vjera thrust a silver piece into his hand and was gone before he
could protest. And in this way she took upon herself the burden of the
Count's debt of honour.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>
</div>

<p>Vjera turned her head when she had reached the corner of the street, and
saw that the Count had disappeared. He had entered the Caf&eacute;, and had
evidently accepted her assurance that she would bring the money without
delay. So far, at least, she had been successful. Though by far the most
difficult portion of the enterprise lay before her, she was convinced
that if she could really produce the fifty marks, the approaching
catastrophe of total madness would be averted. Her determination was
still so strong that she never doubted the possibility of performing her
promise. Without hesitation, she returned to the shop, in search of
Johann Schmidt, to whose energies and kindness she instinctively turned
for counsel and help. As she came to the door she saw that he was just
bidding good-night to his employer. She waited a moment and met him on
the pavement as he came out.</p>

<p>"I must have fifty marks in an hour, Herr Schmidt," she said, boldly.
"If I do not get it, something dreadful will happen."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span></p>

<p>"Fifty marks!" exclaimed the Cossack in a tone of amazement. If she had
said fifty millions, the shock to his financial sense could not have
been more severe. "It is an enormous sum," he said, slowly, while she
fixed her eyes upon him, waiting for his answer. "What is the matter,
Vjera? Have you not been able to pay your rent this year, and has old
Homolka threatened to turn you out?"</p>

<p>"Oh no! It is worse than that, far worse than that! If it were only
myself&mdash;" she hesitated.</p>

<p>"What is it? Who is it? Perhaps it is not so serious as you think. Tell
me all about it."</p>

<p>"There is very little time&mdash;only an hour. He is going mad&mdash;really mad,
Herr Schmidt, because he has given his word of honour to pay Herr
Fischelowitz that money this evening. I only calmed him, by promising to
bring the money at once."</p>

<p>"You promised that?" exclaimed Schmidt. "It was a very wild promise&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I will keep it, and you must help me. We have an hour. If we do not
succeed he will never be himself again."</p>

<p>"But fifty marks!" Schmidt could not recover from his astonishment. "Oh,
Vjera!" he exclaimed at last, in the simplicity of his heart, "how you
must love him!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span></p>

<p>"I would do more than that&mdash;if I could," she answered. "But come, you
will help me, will you not? I have a ten-mark piece and an old thaler
put away at home. That makes thirteen, and two I have in my pocket,
fifteen and&mdash;I am afraid that is all," she concluded after a slight
hesitation.</p>

<p>"And five are twenty," said the Cossack, producing the six which he had,
and taking one silver piece out of the number to be returned to his
pocket. The children must not starve on the morrow.</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you, Herr Schmidt!" cried poor Vjera in a joyful voice as she
eagerly took the proffered coins. "Twenty already! Why, twenty-five will
be half, will it not? And I am sure that we can find the rest, then."</p>

<p>"There is Dumnoff," said Schmidt. "He probably has something, too."</p>

<p>"But I could not borrow of him&mdash;besides, if he knew it was for the
Count&mdash;and he is so rough&mdash;he would not give it to us."</p>

<p>"We shall see," answered the other, who knew his man. "Wait a moment. He
is still inside."</p>

<p>He re-entered the shop, where Fischelowitz and his wife were conversing
under the gaslight.</p>

<p>"I tell you," Akulina was saying, "that it is high time you got rid of
him. The new workman from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span> Vilna will take his place, and it is
positively ridiculous to be made to submit to this madman's humours, and
impertinence. What sort of a man are you, Christian Gregorovitch, to let
the fellow carry off your Gigerl, with his airy promise to pay you the
money to-day?"</p>

<p>"The Gigerl was broken," observed the tobacconist.</p>

<p>"Oh, it could have been mended; and if it was really stolen, was that
our business, I would like to know? Nobody would ever have supposed,
seeing it in our window, that it had been stolen. And it could have been
mended, as I say, and might have been worth something after all. You
never really tried to sell it, as you ought to have done from the very
first. And now you have got nothing at all, nothing but that insolent
maniac's promise. If I were you I would take the money out of his wages,
I would indeed!"</p>

<p>"No doubt you would," said Fischelowitz, with sincere conviction.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Schmidt had gone into the back shop, where Dumnoff was still
doggedly working, making up for the time he had lost by coming late in
the morning. He was alone at his little table.</p>

<p>"How much money have you got?" asked the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span> Cossack, briefly. Dumnoff
looked up rather stupidly, dropped the cigarette he was making, and felt
in his pocket for his change. He produced five marks, an unusual sum for
him to have in his possession, and which would not have found itself in
his hands had not his arrest on the previous evening prevented his
spending considerably more than he had spent in his favourite
corn-brandy.</p>

<p>"I want it all," said Schmidt.</p>

<p>"You are a cool-blooded fellow," laughed Dumnoff, making as though he
would return the coins to his pocket.</p>

<p>"Look here, Dumnoff," answered the Cossack, his bright eyes gleaming. "I
want that money. You know me, and you had better give it to me without
making any trouble."</p>

<p>Dumnoff seemed confused by the sharpness of the demand, and hesitated.</p>

<p>"You seem in a great hurry," he said, with an awkward laugh, "I suppose
you mean to give it back to me?"</p>

<p>"You shall have it at the rate of a mark a day in the next five work
days. You will get your pay this evening and that will be quite enough
for you to get drunk with to-night."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span></p>

<p>"That is true," said Dumnoff, thoughtfully. "Well, take it," he added,
slipping the money into the other's outstretched palm.</p>

<p>"Thank you," said the Cossack. "You are not so bad as you look, Dumnoff.
Good-night." He was gone in a moment.</p>

<p>Dumnoff stared at the door through which he had disappeared.</p>

<p>"After all," he muttered, discontentedly, "he could not have taken it by
force. I wonder why I was such a fool as to give it to him!"</p>

<p>"I tell you," said Akulina to her husband as Schmidt passed through the
outer shop, "that he will end by costing us so much in money lent, and
squandered in charity, that the business will go to dust and feathers! I
am only a weak woman, Christian Gregorovitch, but I have four
children&mdash;"</p>

<p>The Cossack heard no more, for he closed the street door behind him and
returned to Vjera's side. She was standing as he had left her, absorbed
in the contemplation of the financial crisis.</p>

<p>"Five more," said he, giving her the silver. "That is one half. Now for
the other. But are you quite sure, Vjera, that it is as bad as you
think? I know that Fischelowitz does not in the least expect the
money."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span></p>

<p>"No&mdash;I daresay not. But I know this, if I had not met him just now and
promised to bring him the fifty marks, he would have been raving mad
before morning." Schmidt saw by her look that she was convinced of the
fact.</p>

<p>"Very well," he said. "I am not going to turn back now. The poor Count
has done me many a good turn in his time, and I will do my best, though
I do not exactly see what more I can do, at such short notice."</p>

<p>"Have you got anything worth pawning, Herr Schmidt?" asked Vjera,
ruthless, as devoted people can be when the object of their devotion is
in danger.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;I have not much that I can spare. There is the bed&mdash;but my wife
cannot sleep on the floor, though I would myself. And there are a few
pots and pans in the kitchen&mdash;not worth much, and I do not know what we
should do without them. I do not know, I am sure. I cannot take the
children's things, Vjera, even for you."</p>

<p>"No," said Vjera doubtfully. "I suppose not. Of course not!" she
exclaimed, immediately afterwards, with an attempt to express
conviction.</p>

<p>"There is one thing&mdash;there is the old samovar," continued the Cossack.
"It has a leak in one side,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span> and we make the tea as we can, when we have
any. But I remember that I once pawned it, years ago, for five marks."</p>

<p>"That would make thirty," said Vjera promptly.</p>

<p>"I do not believe they would lend so much on it now, though it is good
metal. It is a little battered, besides being leaky."</p>

<p>"Let us get it," said Vjera, beginning to walk briskly on. "I have
something, too, though I do not know what it is worth. It is an old skin
of a wolf&mdash;my father killed it inside the village, just before we came
away."</p>

<p>"A wolf skin!" exclaimed Schmidt. "That may be worth something, if it is
good."</p>

<p>"I am afraid it is not very good," answered Vjera doubtfully. "The hair
comes out. I think it must have been a mangy wolf. And there is a bad
hole on one side."</p>

<p>"It was probably badly cured," said the Cossack, who understood furs.
"But I can mend the hole in five minutes, so that nobody will see it."</p>

<p>"We will get it, too. But I am afraid that it will not be nearly enough
to make up the twenty-five marks. They could not possibly give us twenty
marks for the skin, could they?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed, unless you could sell it to some one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span> who does not
understand those things. And the samovar will not bring five, as I said.
We must find something else."</p>

<p>"Let us get the samovar first," said Vjera decisively. "I will wait
downstairs till you get it, and then you will wait for me where I live,
and after that we will go together. I may find something else. Indeed, I
must, or we shall not have enough."</p>

<p>They walked rapidly through the deepening shadows towards Schmidt's
home. Vjera moved, as people do, who are possessed by an idea which must
be put into immediate execution, her head high, her eyes full of light,
her lips set, her step firm. Her companion was surprised to find that he
needed to walk fast in order to keep by her side. He looked at her
often, as he had looked all day, with an expression that showed at once
much interest, considerable admiration and some pity. If he had not been
lately brought to some new opinion concerning the girl he would
certainly not have entered into her wild scheme for calming the Count's
excitement without at least arguing the case lengthily, and discussing
all the difficulties which presented themselves to his imagination. As
it was, he felt himself carried away by a sort of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span> enthusiasm in her
cause, which would have led him to make even greater sacrifices than he
had it in his power to offer. So strong was this feeling that he felt
called upon to make a sort of apology.</p>

<p>"I am sorry I cannot do more to help you," he said regretfully. "It is
very little I know, but then, you see I am not alone in the world,
Vjera. There are others to be thought of. And besides, I have just paid
the rent, and there are no savings left."</p>

<p>"Dear Herr Schmidt," answered Vjera gratefully, "you are doing too much
already&mdash;but I cannot help taking all you give me, though I can thank
you for it with all my heart."</p>

<p>They did not speak again during the next few minutes, until they reached
the door of the house in which the Cossack lived.</p>

<p>"I shall only need a moment," he said, as he dived into the dark
entrance.</p>

<p>He lost so little time, that it seemed to Vjera as though the echo of
his steps had not died away upon the stairs before she heard his
footfall again as he descended. This time, however, there was a rattle
and clatter of metal to be heard as well as his quick tread and the loud
creaking of his coarse, stiff shoes. He emerged into the street with the
body of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span> samovar under one arm. The movable brass chimney of the
machine was sticking out of one of his pockets, and in his left hand he
had its little tray, with the rings and other pieces belonging to the
whole. Amongst those latter objects, which he grasped tightly in his
fingers, there figured also the fragment of a small spoon of which the
bowl had been broken from the handle.</p>

<p>"It is silver," he said, referring to the latter utensil, as he held up
the whole handful before Vjera's eyes. "But if we can find a jeweller's
shop open, we will sell it. We can get more for it in that way. And now
your wolf's skin, Vjera. And be sure to bring me a needle and some
strong thread when you come down. I can mend the hole by the gaslight in
the street, for Homolka would not understand it if he saw me going to
your room, you know."</p>

<p>She helped him to put all the smaller things into his pockets, so that
he had only the samovar itself, and its metal tray to carry in his
hands, and then they went briskly on towards Vjera's lodging.</p>

<p>"Do you think we shall get three marks for the little spoon?" she asked,
constantly preoccupied by her calculations.</p>

<p>"Oh yes," Schmidt answered cheerfully. "We<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span> may get five. It is good
silver, and they buy silver by weight."</p>

<p>A few moments later she stood still before a narrow shop which was
lighted within, though there was no lamp in the windows. It was that of
a small watchmaker and jeweller, and a few silver watches and some cheap
chains and trinkets were visible behind the glass pane.</p>

<p>"Perhaps he may buy the spoon," suggested Vjera, anxious to lose no
time.</p>

<p>Without a word Schmidt entered the shop, while the girl stood outside.
In less than five minutes he came out again with something in his hand.</p>

<p>"Three and a half," he said, handing her the money.</p>

<p>"I had hoped it would be worth more," she answered, putting the coins
with the rest.</p>

<p>"No. He weighed it with silver marks. It weighed just four of them, and
he said he must have half a mark to make it worth his while."</p>

<p>"Very well," said Vjera, "it is always something. I have twenty-eight
and a half now."</p>

<p>When they reached her lodging Schmidt set down the samovar upon the
pavement and made himself a cigarette, while he waited for her. She was
gone a long time, as it seemed to him, and he was beginning to wonder
whether anything had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span> happened, when she suddenly made her appearance,
noiseless in her walk, as always. The old wolf's skin was hung over one
shoulder, and she carried besides a limp-looking brown paper parcel,
tied with a bit of folded ribband. As he caught sight of her face in the
light of the street lamp, Schmidt fancied that she was paler than
before, and that her cheek was wet.</p>

<p>"I am sorry I was so long," she said. "The little sister cried because I
would not stay, and I had to quiet her. Here is the skin. Do you see? I
am afraid this is a very big hole&mdash;and the hair comes out in handfuls.
Look at it."</p>

<p>"It was a very old wolf," remarked the Cossack, holding the skin up
under the gaslight.</p>

<p>"Does that make it worth less?" asked Vjera anxiously.</p>

<p>"Not of itself; on the contrary. And I can mend the hole, if you have
the thread and needle. The worst thing about it all is the way the hairs
fall out. I am afraid the moths have been at it, Vjera." He shook his
head gravely. "I am afraid the moths have done a great deal of damage."</p>

<p>"Oh, if I had only known&mdash;I would have been so careful! And to think
that it might have been worth something."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is worth something as it is, but at the pawnbroker's they will not
lend much on it." He took the threaded needle, which she had not
forgotten, and sitting down upon the edge of the pavement spread the
skin upon his knees with the fur downwards. Then he quickly began to
draw the hole together, sewing it firmly with the furrier's cross
stitch, and so neatly that the seam looked like a single straight line
on the side of the leather, while it was quite invisible in the fur on
the other.</p>

<p>"What is the other thing you have brought?" he inquired without looking
up from his work. The light was bad, and he had to bend his eyes close
to the sewing.</p>

<p>"It is something I may be able to sell," said Vjera in a rather unsteady
voice.</p>

<p>"Silver?" asked Schmidt, cheerfully.</p>

<p>"Oh no&mdash;not silver&mdash;something dearer," she said, almost under her
breath. "I am afraid it is very hard for you to see," she added quickly,
attempting to avoid his questions. "Do you not think that I could hold a
match for you, to make a little more light? You always have some with
you."</p>

<p>"Wait a moment&mdash;yes&mdash;I have almost finished the seam&mdash;here is the box.
Now, if you can hold<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span> the match just there, just over the needle, and
keep it from going out, I can finish the end off neatly."</p>

<p>Vjera knelt down beside him and held the flickering bit of wood as well
as she was able. They made a strange picture, out in the unfrequented
street, the dim glare of the gaslight above them, and the redder flame
of the match making odd tints and shadows in their faces. Vjera's shawl
had slipped back from her head and her thick tress of red-brown hair had
found its way over her shoulder. An artist, strolling supperwards from
his studio, came down their side of the way. He stopped and looked at
them.</p>

<p>"Has anything happened?" he asked kindly. "Can I be of any use?"</p>

<p>Vjera looked up with a frightened glance. The Cossack paid no attention
to the stranger.</p>

<p>"Oh no, thank you&mdash;thank you, sir, it is nothing&mdash;only a little piece of
work to finish."</p>

<p>The artist gave one more look and passed on, wishing that he could have
had pencil and paper and light at his command for five minutes.</p>

<p>"There," said Schmidt triumphantly. "It is done, and very well done. And
now for the pawn-shop, Vjera!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span></p>

<p>Vjera took the skin over her arm and her companion picked up the samovar
with its tray, and they moved on again. Vjera's face was pale and sad,
but she seemed more confident of success than ever, and her step was
elastic and hopeful. Johann Schmidt's curiosity was very great, as has
been seen on previous occasions. He did his best to control it, for some
time, only trying to guess from the general appearance of the limp
parcel what it might contain. But his ingenuity failed to solve the
problem. At last he could bear it no longer. They were entering the
street where the pawnbroker's shop was situated when his resolution
broke down.</p>

<p>"Is it a piece of lace?" he asked at a venture. "If it is, you know, and
if it is good, it may be worth all the other things together."</p>

<p>"No. It is not a piece of lace," answered the girl. "I will tell you
what it is, if we do not get enough without it."</p>

<p>"I only thought," explained the Cossack, "that if we were going to try
and pawn it, I had better know&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We cannot pawn it," said Vjera decisively. "It will have to be sold.
Let us go in together." She spoke the last words as they reached the
door of the pawn-shop.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span></p>

<p>"I could save you the trouble," Schmidt suggested, offering to take the
wolf's skin. But Vjera would not give it up. She felt that she must see
everything done herself, if only to distract her thoughts from more
painful matters.</p>

<p>The place was half full of people, most of them with anxious faces, and
all having some object or other in their hands. The pawn-shops do their
best business in the evening. A man and a woman, both advanced in middle
age, well fed, parsimoniously washed and possessing profiles of an
outline disquieting to Christian prejudices, leaned over the counter,
handled the articles offered them, consulted each other in
incomprehensible monosyllables, talked volubly to the customers in oily
undertones and from time to time counted out small doses of change which
they gave to the eager recipients, accompanied by little slips of paper
on which there were both printed and written words. The room was warm
and redolent of poverty. A broad flame of gas burned, without a shade,
over the middle of the counter.</p>

<p>In spite of their unctuous tones the Hebrew and his wife did their
business rapidly, with sharpness and decision. Either one of them would
have undertaken to name the precise pawning value of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span> anything on earth
and, possibly, of most things in heaven, provided that the universe were
brought piecemeal to their counter. Both Vjera and Schmidt had been made
acquainted by previous necessities with the establishment. Vjera held
her paper parcel in her hand. The other things were laid together upon
the counter. The Hebrew woman glanced at the samovar, felt the weight of
it and turned it once round.</p>

<p>"Leaky," she observed in her smooth voice. "Old brass. One mark and a
half." Her husband put out his hand, touched the machine, lifted it, and
nodded.</p>

<p>"Only a mark and a half!" exclaimed Vjera. "And the skin, how much for
that?"</p>

<p>"It is a genuine Russian wolf," Schmidt put in. "And it is very large."</p>

<p>"Moth-eaten," said the Jewess. "And there is a hole in the side. Five
marks."</p>

<p>Schmidt held the fur up to the light and blew into it with a
professional air, as furriers do.</p>

<p>"Look at that!" he cried, persuasively. "Why, it is worth twenty!"</p>

<p>The Hebrew lady, instead of answering extended a fat thumb and a plump,
pointed forefinger, and pinching a score of hairs between the two,
pulled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span> them out without effort, and then held them close to the
Cossack's eyes.</p>

<p>"Five marks," she repeated, getting the money out and preparing to fill
in a couple of pawn-tickets.</p>

<p>"Make it ten, with the samovar!" entreated Vjera. The Jewess smiled.</p>

<p>"Do you think the samovar is of gold?" she inquired. "Six and a half for
the two. Take it or leave it."</p>

<p>Vjera looked at Schmidt anxiously as though to ask his opinion.</p>

<p>"They will not give more," he said, in Russian.</p>

<p>The girl took the money and the flimsy tickets and they went out into
the street. Vjera hesitated as to the direction she should take, and
Schmidt looked to her as though awaiting her orders.</p>

<p>"Twenty-eight and a half and six and a half are thirty-five," she said,
thoughtfully. "And we have nothing more to give, but this. I must sell
it, Herr Schmidt."</p>

<p>"Well, what is it?" he asked, glad to know the secret at last.</p>

<p>"It is my mother's hair. She cut it off herself when she knew she was
dying and she told me to sell it if ever I needed a little money."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span></p>

<p>The girl's voice trembled violently, and she turned her head away.
Schmidt was silent and very grave. Then Vjera began to move on again,
clutching the precious thing to her bosom and drawing her shawl over it.</p>

<p>"The best man for this lives in the Maffei Strasse," said Schmidt after
a few minutes.</p>

<p>"Show me the way." Vjera turned as he directed. At that moment she would
have lost herself in the familiar streets, had he not been there to
guide her.</p>

<p>The hairdresser's shop was brilliantly lighted, and as good fortune
would have it, there were no customers within. With an entreating glance
which he obeyed, Vjera made Schmidt wait outside.</p>

<p>"Please do not look!" she whispered. "I can bear it better alone." The
good fellow nodded and began to walk up and down.</p>

<p>As Vjera entered the shop, the chief barber in command waltzed forward,
as hairdressers always seem to waltz. At the sight of the poor girl,
however, he assumed a stern appearance which, to tell the truth, was out
of character with his style of beauty. His rich brown locks were curled
and anointed in a way that might have aroused envy in the heart of an
Assyrian dandy in the palmy days of Sardanapalus.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you buy hair?" asked Vjera, timidly offering her limp parcel.</p>

<p>"Oh, certainly, sometimes," answered the barber. The youth in
attendance&mdash;the barber tadpole of the hairdresser frog&mdash;abandoned the
cleansing of a comb and came forward with a leer, in the hope that Vjera
might turn out to be pretty on a closer inspection. In this he was
disappointed.</p>

<p>The man took the parcel and laid it on one of the narrow marble tables
placed before a mirror in a richly gilt frame. He pushed aside the blue
glass powder-box, the vial of brilliantine and the brushes. Vjera untied
the bit of faded ribband herself and opened the package. The contents
exhaled a faint, sickly odour.</p>

<p>A tress of beautiful hair, of unusual length and thickness, lay in the
paper. The colour was that which is now so much sought after, and which
great ladies endeavour to produce upon their own hair, when they have
any, by washing it with extra-dry champagne, while little ladies imitate
them with a humble solution of soda. The colour in question is a
reddish-brown with rich golden lights in it, and it is very rare in
nature.</p>

<p>The barber eyed the thick plait with a businesslike expression.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span></p>

<p>"The colour is not so bad," he remarked, as though suggesting that it
might have been very much better.</p>

<p>"Surely, it is very beautiful hair!" said Vjera, her heart almost
breaking at the sight of the tenderly treasured heirloom.</p>

<p>Suddenly the man snuffed the odour, lifted the tress to his nose, and
smelt it. Then he laid it down again and took the thicker end, which was
tied tightly with a ribband, in his hands, pulling at the short lengths
of hair which projected beyond the knot. They broke very easily, with an
odd, soft snap.</p>

<p>"It is worth nothing at all," said the barber decisively. "It is a pity,
for it is a very pretty colour."</p>

<p>Vjera started, and steadied herself against the back of the professional
chair which stood by the table.</p>

<p>"Nothing?" she repeated, half stupid with the pain of her
disappointment. "Nothing? not even fifteen marks?"</p>

<p>"Nothing. It is rotten, and could not be worked. The hairs break like
glass."</p>

<p>Vjera pressed her left hand to her side as though something hurt her.
The tadpole youth grinned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span> idiotically and the barber seemed anxious to
end the interview.</p>

<p>With a look of broken-hearted despair the girl turned to the table and
began to do up her parcel again. Her shawl fell to the ground as she
moved. Then the tadpole nudged his employer and pointed at Vjera's long,
red-brown braid, and grinned again from ear to ear.</p>

<p>"Is it fifteen marks that you want?" asked the man.</p>

<p>"Fifteen&mdash;yes&mdash;I must have fifteen," repeated Vjera in dull tones.</p>

<p>"I will give it to you for your own hair," said the barber with a short
laugh.</p>

<p>"For my own?" cried Vjera, suddenly turning round. It had never occurred
to her that her own tress could be worth anything. "For my own?" she
repeated as though not believing her ears.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;let me see," said the man. "Turn your head again, please. Let me
see. Yes, yes, it is good hair of the kind, though it has not the gold
lights in it that the other had. But, to oblige you, I will give you
fifteen for it."</p>

<p>"But I must have the money now," said Vjera, suspiciously. "You must
give me the money now, to take with me. I cannot wait."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span></p>

<p>The barber smiled, and produced a gold piece and five silver ones.</p>

<p>"You may hold the money in your hand," he said, offering it to her,
"while you sit down and I do the work."</p>

<p>Vjera clutched the coins fiercely and placed herself in the big chair
before the mirror. She could see in the glass that her eyes were on
fire. The barber loosened a screw in the back of the seat and removed
the block with the cushion, handing it to his assistant.</p>

<p>"The scissors, and a comb, Anton," he said briskly, lifting at the same
time the heavy tress and judging its weight. The reflection of the steel
flashed in the mirror, as the artist quickly opened and shut the
scissors, with that peculiar shuffling jingle which only barbers can
produce.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute!" cried Vjera, with sudden anxiety, and turning her head
as though to draw away her hair from his grasp. "One
minute&mdash;please&mdash;fifteen and thirty-five are really fifty, are they not?"</p>

<p>The tadpole began to count on his fingers, whispering audibly.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered the barber. "Fifteen and thirty-five are fifty."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span></p>

<p>The tadpole desisted, having already got into mathematical difficulties
in counting from one hand over to the other.</p>

<p>"Then cut it off quickly, please!" said poor Vjera, settling herself in
the chair again, and giving her head to the shears.</p>

<p>In the silence that followed, only the soft jingle of the scissors was
heard.</p>

<p>"There!" exclaimed the hairdresser, holding up a hand-mirror behind her.
"I have been generous, you see. I have not cut it very short. See for
yourself."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Vjera. "You are very kind." She saw nothing, indeed,
but she was satisfied, and rose quickly.</p>

<p>She tied up the limp parcel with the same old piece of faded ribband,
and a little colour suddenly came into her face as she pressed it to her
bosom. All at once, she lost control of herself, and with a sharp sob
the tears gushed out. She stooped a little and drew her shawl over her
head to hide her face. The tears wet her hands and the brown paper, and
fell down to the greasy marble floor of the shop.</p>

<p>"It will grow again very soon," said the barber, not unkindly. He
supposed, naturally enough, that she was weeping over her sacrifice.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh no! It is not that!" she cried. "I am so&mdash;so happy to have kept
this!" Then, without another word, she slipped noiselessly out into the
street, clasping the precious relic to her breast.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>
</div>

<p>"I have got it&mdash;I have got it all!" cried Vjera, as she came up with
Schmidt on the pavement. His quick eye caught sight of the parcel, only
half hidden by her shawl.</p>

<p>"But you have brought the hair away with you," he said, in some anxiety,
and fearing a mistake or some new trouble.</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered. "That is the best of it." Her tears had disappeared
as suddenly as they had come, and she could now hardly restrain the
nervous laughter that rose to her lips.</p>

<p>"But how is that?" asked Schmidt, stopping.</p>

<p>"I gave them my own," she laughed, hysterically. "I gave them my
own&mdash;instead. Quick, quick&mdash;there is no time to lose. Is it an hour yet,
since I left him?" She ran along, and Schmidt found it hard to keep
beside her without running, too. At last he broke into a sort of
jog-trot. In five minutes they were at the door of the caf&eacute;.</p>

<p>The Count was sitting at a small table near the door, an empty
coffee-cup before him, staring with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span> a fixed look at the opposite wall.
There were few people in the place, as the performances at the theatres
had already begun. Vjera entered alone.</p>

<p>"I have brought you the money," she said, joyfully, as she stood beside
him and laid a hand upon his arm to attract his attention, for he had
not noticed her coming.</p>

<p>"The money?" he said, excitedly. "The fifty marks? You have got it?"</p>

<p>She sat down at the table, and began to count the gold and silver,
producing it from her pocket in instalments of four or five coins, and
making little heaps of them before him.</p>

<p>"It is all there&mdash;every penny of it," she said, counting the piles
again.</p>

<p>The poor man's eyes seemed starting from his head, as he leaned eagerly
forward over the money.</p>

<p>"Is it real? Is it true?" he asked in a low voice. "Oh, Vjera, do not
laugh at me&mdash;is it really true, child?"</p>

<p>"Really true&mdash;fifty marks." Her pale face beamed with pleasure. "And now
you can go and pay Fischelowitz at once," she added.</p>

<p>But he leaned back a moment in his chair, looking at her intently. Then
his eyes grew moist, and, when he spoke, his voice quivered.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span></p>

<p>"May God forgive me for taking it of you," he said. "You have saved me,
Vjera&mdash;saved my honour, my life&mdash;all. God bless you, dear, God bless
you! I am very, very thankful."</p>

<p>He put the coins carefully together and wrapped them in his silk
handkerchief, and rose from his seat. He had already paid for his cup of
coffee. They went out together. The Cossack had disappeared.</p>

<p>"You have saved my life and my honour&mdash;my honour and my life," repeated
the Count, softly and dwelling on the words in a dreamy way.</p>

<p>"I will wait outside," said Vjera as they reached the tobacconist's
shop, a few seconds later.</p>

<p>The Count turned to her and laid both hands upon her shoulders, looking
into her face.</p>

<p>"You cannot understand what you have done for me," he said earnestly.</p>

<p>He stooped, for he was much taller than she, and closing his tired eyes
for a moment, he pressed his lips upon her waxen forehead. Before he had
seen the bright blush that glowed in her cheeks, he had entered the
shop.</p>

<p>Akulina was seated in one corner, apparently in a bad humour, for her
dark face was flushed, and her small eyes looked up savagely at the
Count. Her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span> husband was leaning over the counter, smoking and making a
series of impressions in violet ink upon the back of an old letter, with
an india-rubber stamp in which the word "Celebrated Manufactory" held a
prominent place. He nodded familiarly.</p>

<p>"Herr Fischelowitz," said the Count, regaining suddenly his dignity of
manner and bearing, "in the course of the conversation last evening, I
said that I would to-day refund the fifty marks which you once lent to
that atrocious young man who wore green glasses. I daresay you remember
the circumstance?"</p>

<p>"I had quite forgotten it," said Fischelowitz. "Please do not allow it
to trouble you, my dear Count. I never considered you responsible for
it, and of course you cannot&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is a shame!" Akulina broke in, angrily. "You ought to make him pay
it out of what he earns, since he took the Gigerl!"</p>

<p>"Madam," said the Count, addressing her with great civility, "if it is
agreeable to you, we will not discuss the matter. I only reminded Herr
Fischelowitz of what took place because&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Because you have no money&mdash;of course!" interrupted Akulina.</p>

<p>"On the contrary, because I have brought the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span> money, and shall be
obliged to you if you will count it."</p>

<p>Akulina's jaw dropped, and Fischelowitz looked up in amazement. The
Count produced his knotted handkerchief and laid it on the table.</p>

<p>"I only wish you to understand," he said, speaking to Akulina, "that
when a gentleman gives his word he keeps it. Will you do me the favour
to count the money?"</p>

<p>"Of course, it is no business of ours to find out how he got it,"
observed Akulina, rising and coming forward.</p>

<p>"None whatever, madam," answered the Count, spreading out the coins
which had been collected by loving hands from so many sources. "The only
question is, to ascertain whether there are fifty marks here or not."</p>

<p>Fischelowitz stood looking on. He had not yet recovered from his
surprise, and was half afraid that there might be something wrong. But
the practical Akulina lost no time in assuring herself that the sum was
complete. As she realised this fact, her features relaxed into a
pleasant smile.</p>

<p>"Well, Count," she said, "we are very much obliged to you for this. It
is very honest of you, for of course, you were not exactly called
upon&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span></p>

<p>"I understood you to say that I was," replied the Count, gravely.</p>

<p>"Oh, that was yesterday, and I am very sorry if I annoyed you. But let
bygones be bygones! I hope there is no ill-will between us?"</p>

<p>"Oh, none at all," returned the other indifferently. "I have the honour
to wish you a very good evening." Without waiting for more, the Count
bowed and left the shop.</p>

<p>"Akulina," said Fischelowitz, thoughtfully, as the door closed, "that
man is a gentleman, say what you please."</p>

<p>"A pretty gentleman," laughed Akulina, putting the money into the till.
"A gentleman indeed&mdash;why, look at his coat!"</p>

<p>"And you are a fool, Akulina," added Fischelowitz, handling his
india-rubber stamp.</p>

<p>"Thank you; but for my foolery you would be fifty marks poorer to-night,
Christian Gregorovitch. A gentleman, pah!"</p>

<p>The Count had drawn Vjera's willing arm through his, and they were
walking slowly away together.</p>

<p>"I must be going home," she said, reluctantly. "The little sister will
be crying for me. I cannot leave her any longer."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not till I have thanked you, dear," he answered, pressing her arm to
his side. "But I will go with you to your door, and thank you all the
way&mdash;though the way is far too short for all I have to say."</p>

<p>"I have done nothing&mdash;it has really cost me nothing." Vjera squeezed her
limp parcel under her shawl, and felt that she was speaking the truth.</p>

<p>"I cannot believe that, Vjera," said the Count. "You could not have
found so much money so quickly, without making some great sacrifice. But
I will give it back to you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh no&mdash;no," she cried, earnestly. "Make no promises to me. Think what
this promise has cost you. When you have the money, you may give it back
if you choose&mdash;but it would make me so unhappy if you promised."</p>

<p>"Would it, child? And yet, my friends are waiting for me, and they have
money for me, too. Then, I will only say that I will give it back to you
as soon as possible. Is that right?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;and nothing more than that. And as for thanking me&mdash;what have I
done that needs thanks? Would you not have done as much for me if&mdash;if,
for instance, I had been ill, and could not pay the rent of the room?
And then&mdash;think of the happiness I have had!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span></p>

<p>The words were spoken so simply and it was so clear that they were true,
that the Count found it hard to answer. Not because he had nothing to
express, but because the words for the expression could not be found.
Again he pressed her arm.</p>

<p>"Vjera," he said, when they had walked some distance farther, "it is of
no use to speak of this. There is that between you and me which makes
speech contemptible and words ridiculous. There is only one thing that I
can do, Vjera dearest. I can love you, dear, with all my heart. Will you
take my love for thanks&mdash;and my devotion for gratitude? Will you, dear?
Will you remember what you promised and what I promised last night? As
soon as all is right, to-morrow, will you be my wife?"</p>

<p>"If it could ever be!" sighed the poor girl, recalled suddenly to the
remembrance of his pitiful infirmity.</p>

<p>"It can be, it shall be and it will be," he answered in tones of
conviction. "They are waiting for me now, Vjera, in my little room&mdash;but
they may wait, for I will not lose a moment of your dear company for
them all. They are waiting for me with the money and the papers and the
orders. I have waited long for them, they can afford to have a little
patience<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span> now. And to-morrow, at this time, we shall be together, Vjera,
in the train&mdash;I will have a special carriage for you and me, and then, a
night and a day and another night and we shall be at home&mdash;for ever. How
happy we shall be! Will you not be happy with me, darling? Why do you
sigh?"</p>

<p>"Did I sigh?" asked Vjera, trying to laugh a little.</p>

<p>He hardly noticed the question, but began to talk again, as he had
talked on the previous evening, describing all that he meant to do, and
all that they would do together. Vjera heard and tried not to listen.
Her joy was all gone. The great, overwhelming pleasure she had felt in
dispelling his anxiety and in averting what had seemed a near and
terrible catastrophe, gave place to the old, heartrending pity for him,
as he rambled on in his delusion. She had hoped that, as it was late on
Wednesday evening, the time of it was passed and that, for another week,
he would talk no more of his friends and his money and his return to
fortune. But the fixed idea was there still, as dominant as ever. Her
light tread grew weary and her head sank forward as she walked. For one
short hour she had felt the glory of sacrificing all she had to give, to
her love. Are there many who have felt as much, with as good reason, in
a whole lifetime?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span></p>

<p>But the hour was gone, taking with it the reality and leaving in its
place a memory, fair, brilliant, and dear as the tress of golden hair
Vjera was carrying home in her parcel, but as useless perhaps and as
valueless in the world of realities as that had proved to be.</p>

<p>They reached her door and stopped in their walk. She looked up sadly
into his eyes, as she held out her hand. He hesitated a moment, and then
threw both his arms round her and drew her to his heart and kissed her
passionately again and again. She tried to draw back.</p>

<p>"Oh no, no!" she cried. "It cannot be so to-morrow&mdash;why should you kiss
me to-day?" But he would not let her go. She loved him, though she knew
he was mad, and she let her head fall upon his shoulder, and allowed
herself to believe in love for a moment.</p>

<p>Suddenly she felt that he was startled by something.</p>

<p>"Vjera!" he cried. "Have you cut off your beautiful hair? What have you
done, child? How could you do it?"</p>

<p>"It was so heavy," she said, looking up with a bright smile. "It made my
head ache&mdash;it is best so."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span></p>

<p>But he was not satisfied, for he guessed something of the truth, and the
pain and horror that thrilled him told him that he had guessed rightly.</p>

<p>"You have cut it off&mdash;and you have sold it&mdash;you have sold your hair for
me&mdash;" he stammered in a broken voice.</p>

<p>She hung her head a little.</p>

<p>"I always meant to cut it off. I did not care for it, you know. And
besides," she added, suddenly looking up again, "you will not love me
less, will you? They said it would grow again&mdash;you will not love me
less?"</p>

<p>"Love you less? Ah, Vjera, that promise I may make at least&mdash;never&mdash;to
the end of ends!"</p>

<p>"And yet," she answered, "if it should all be true&mdash;if it only
should&mdash;you could not&mdash;oh, I should not be worthy of you&mdash;you could
never marry me."</p>

<p>The Count drew back a step and held out his right hand, with a strangely
earnest look in his weary eyes. She laid her fingers in his almost
unconsciously. Then, as though he were in a holy place, he took off his
hat, and stood bareheaded before her.</p>

<p>"If I forsake you, Vjera," he said very solemnly, "if I forsake you
ever, in riches or in poverty, in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span> honour or in disrepute, may the God
of heaven forsake me in the hour of my death."</p>

<p>He swore the great oath deliberately, in a strong, clear voice, and then
was silent for a moment, his eyes turned upwards, his attitude
unchanged. Then he raised the poor girl's thin hand to his lips and
kissed it, three times, reverently, as devout persons kiss the relics of
departed saints.</p>

<p>"Good-night, Vjera," he said, quietly. "We shall meet to-morrow."</p>

<p>Vjera was awed by his solemn earnestness, and strongly moved by his
action.</p>

<p>"Good-night," she answered, lovingly. "Heaven bless you and keep you
safe." She looked for a last time into his face, as though trying to
impress upon her mind the memories of that fateful evening, and then she
withdrew into the house, shutting the street door behind her.</p>

<p>The Count stood still for several minutes, unconsciously holding his hat
in his hand. At last he covered his head and walked slowly away in the
direction of his home. By degrees his mind fell into its old groove and
he hastened his steps. From time to time, he fancied that some one was
following him at no great distance, but though he glanced quickly over
his shoulder he saw no one in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span> dimly-lighted street. The door of the
house in which he lived was open, and he ran up the stairs at a great
pace, sure that by this time his friends must be waiting for him in his
room. When he reached it, all was dark and quiet. The echo of his own
footsteps seemed still to resound in the staircase as he closed his door
and struck a match. He found his small lamp in a corner, lighted it with
some difficulty, set it on the table and sat down. There, beside him,
propped up against two books, was the piece of paper on which he had
written the few words for his friends, in case they came while he was
out. He took it up, looked over it absently and began to fold it upon
itself again and again.</p>

<p>"Dear Vjera!" he exclaimed, in a low caressing tone, as he smoothed the
folded strip between his fingers.</p>

<p>He was thinking, and thinking connectedly, of all that had just taken
place, and wondering how it was that he had been able to accept such a
sacrifice from one so little able to sacrifice anything. It seemed as
though it should have been impossible for him to let the poor little
shell-maker take upon herself his burden, and free him of it and set him
right again in his own eyes.</p>

<p>"I know that I love her now," he said to himself.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span></p>

<p>And he was right. There are secret humiliations to which no man would
submit, as such, but from which love, when it is real, can take away the
sting and the poison. The man of heart, who does not love but is loved
in spite of himself, fears to accept a sacrifice, lest in so doing he
should seem to declare his readiness to do as he is done by, from like
motives. But when love is on both sides there is no such drawing back
from love's responsibilities. The sacrifice is accepted not only with
gratitude, but with joy, as a debt of which the repayment by sacrifice
again constitutes in itself a happiness. And thus, perhaps, it is that
they love best who love in sorrow and in want, in worldly poverty and in
distress of soul, for they alone can know what joy it is to receive, and
what yet infinitely greater joy lies in giving all when all is sorely
needed.</p>

<p>But as the Count dwelt on the circumstances he saw also what it was that
Vjera had done, and he wondered how she could have found the strength to
do it. He did not, indeed, say to himself that for his sake she had
parted with her only beauty, for he had never considered whether she
were good-looking or not. The bond between them was of a different
nature, and would not have been less strong had Vjera been absolutely
ugly instead of being merely,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span> what is called, plain. He would have
loved her as well, had she been a cripple, or deformed, just as she
loved him in spite of his madness. But he knew well enough how women,
even the most wretched, value their hair when it is beautiful, what care
they bestow upon it and what consolation they derive from the rich,
silken coil denied to fairer women than themselves. There is something
in the thought of cutting off the heavy tress and selling it which
appeals to the pity of most people, and which, to women themselves, is
full of horror. A man might have felt the same in those days when long
locks were the distinctive outward sign of nobility in man, and perhaps
the respect of that obsolete custom has left in the minds of most people
a sort of unconscious tradition. However that may be, we all feel that
in one direction, at least, a woman's sacrifice can go no further than
in giving her head to the shears.</p>

<p>The longer the Count thought of this, the more his gratitude increased,
and the more fully he realised at what great cost poor Vjera had saved
him from what he considered the greatest conceivable dishonour, from the
shame of breaking his word, no matter under what conditions it had been
given. He could, of course, repay her the money, so soon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span> as his friends
arrived, but by no miracle whatever could he restore to her head the
only beauty it had ever possessed. He had scarcely understood this at
first, for he had been confused and shaken by the many emotions which
had in succession played upon his nervous mind and body during the past
twenty-four hours. But now he saw it all very clearly. He had taken only
money, which he would be able to restore; she had given a part of
herself, irrevocably.</p>

<p>So deeply absorbed was he in his thoughts that the clocks struck many
successive quarters without rousing him from his reverie, or suggesting
again to him the fixed idea by which his life was governed on that day
of the week. But as midnight drew near, the prolonged striking of the
bells at every quarter at last attracted his attention. He started
suddenly and rose from his seat, trying to count the strokes, but he had
not heard the first ones and was astray in his reckoning. It was very
late, that was certain, and not many minutes could elapse before the
door would open and his friends would enter. He hastily smoothed his
hair, looked to the flame of his bright little lamp and made a trip of
inspection round the room. Everything was in order. He was almost glad
that they were to come at night, for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span> the lamplight seemed to lend a
more cheerful look to the room. The Turkey-red cotton counterpane on the
bed looked particularly well, the Count thought. During the next fifteen
minutes he walked about, rubbing his hands softly together. At the first
stroke of the following quarter he stood still and listened intently.</p>

<p>Four quarters struck, and then the big bell began to toll the hour. It
must be eleven, he thought, as he counted the strokes.
Eleven&mdash;twelve&mdash;he started, and turned very white, but listened still,
for he knew that he should hear another clock striking in a few seconds.
As the strokes followed each other, his heart beat like a
fulling-hammer, giving a succession of quick blows, and pausing to
repeat the rhythmic tattoo more loudly and painfully than before.
Ten&mdash;eleven&mdash;twelve&mdash;there was no mistake. The day was over. It was
midnight, and no one had come. The room swam with him.</p>

<p>Then, as in a vision of horror, he saw himself standing there, as he had
stood many times before, listening for the last stroke, and suddenly
awaking from the dream to the crushing disappointment of the reality.
For one brief and terrible moment his whole memory was restored to him
and he knew that his madness was only madness, and nothing more,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span> and
that it seized him in the same way, week by week, through the months and
the years, leaving him thus on the stroke of twelve each Wednesday
night, a broken, miserable, self-deceived man. As in certain dreams, we
dream that we have dreamed the same things before, so with him an
endless calendar of Wednesdays was unrolled before his inner sight, all
alike, all ending in the same terror of conscious madness.</p>

<p>He had dreamed it all, there was no one to come to him in his distress,
no one would ever enter that lonely room to bring back to him the
treasures of a glorious past, for there was no one to come. It had all
been a dream from beginning to end and there was no reality in it.</p>

<p>He staggered to his chair and sat down, pressing his lean hands to his
aching temples and rocking himself to and fro, his breath hissing
through his convulsively closed teeth. Still the fearful memory
remained, and it grew into a prophetic vision of the future, reflecting
what had been upon the distant scenery of what was yet to be. With that
one deadly stroke of the great church bell, all was gone&mdash;fortune,
friends, wealth, dignity. The majestic front of the palace of his hopes
was but a flimsy, painted tissue. The fire that ran through his
tortured<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span> brain consumed the gaudy, artificial thing in the flash and
rush of a single flame, and left behind only the charred skeleton
framework, which had supported the vast canvas. And then, he saw it
again and again looming suddenly out of the darkness, brightening into
beauty and the semblance of strength, to be as suddenly destroyed once
more. With each frantic beat of his heart the awful transformation was
renewed. For dreams need not time to spin out their intolerable length.
With each burning throb of his raging blood, every nerve in his body,
every aching recess of his brain, was pierced and twisted, and pierced
again with unceasing agony.</p>

<p>Then a new horror was added to the rest. He saw before him the poor
Polish girl, her only beauty shorn away for his sake, he saw all that he
had promised in return, and he knew that he had nothing to give her,
nothing, absolutely, save the crazy love of a wretched madman. He could
not even repay her the miserable money which had cost her so dear. Out
of his dreams of fortune there was not so much as a handful of coin left
to give the girl who had given all she had, who had sold her hair to
save his honour. With frightful vividness the truth came over him. That
honour of his, he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span> had pledged it in the recklessness of his madness.
She had saved it out of love, and he had not even&mdash;but no&mdash;there was a
new memory there&mdash;love he had for her, passionate, tender, true, a love
that had not its place among the terrors of the past. But&mdash;was not this
a new dream, a new delusion of his shaken brain? And if he loved her,
was it not yet more terrible to have deceived the loved one, more
monstrous, more infamous, more utterly damnable? The figure of her rose
before him, pitiful, thin, weak, with outstretched hands and trusting
eyes&mdash;and he had taken of her all she had. Neither heart, nor body, nor
brain could bear more.</p>

<p>"Vjera! God! Forgive me!" With the cry of a breaking heart the poor
Count fell forward from his seat and lay in a heap, motionless upon the
floor.</p>

<p>Only his stiffening fingers, crooked and contorted, worked nervously for
a few minutes, scratching at the rough boards. Then all was quite still
in the little room.</p>

<p>There was a noise outside, and some one opened the door. The Cossack
stood upon the threshold, holding his hand up against the lamp, for he
was dazzled as he entered from the outer darkness of the stairs. He
looked about, and at first saw nothing, for the Count had fallen in the
shadow of the table.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span></p>

<p>Then, seeing where he lay, Johann Schmidt came forward and knelt down,
and with some difficulty turned his friend upon his back.</p>

<p>"Dead&mdash;poor Count!" he exclaimed in a low voice, bending down over the
ghastly face.</p>

<p>The pale eyes were turned upward and inward, and the forehead was damp.
Schmidt unbuttoned the threadbare coat from the breast. There was no
waistcoat under it&mdash;nothing but a patched flannel shirt. A quantity of
papers were folded neatly in a flat package in the inner pocket. Schmidt
put down his head and listened for the beatings of the heart.</p>

<p>"So it is over!" he said mournfully, as he straightened himself upon his
knees. Then he took one of the extended hands in his, and pressed it,
and looked into the poor man's face, and felt the tears coming into his
eyes.</p>

<p>"You were a good man," he said in sorrowful tones, "and a brave man in
your way, and a true gentleman&mdash;and&mdash;I suppose it was not your fault if
you were mad. Heaven give you peace and rest!"</p>

<p>He rose to his feet, debating what he should do.</p>

<p>"Poor Vjera!" he sighed. "Poor Vjera&mdash;she will go next!"</p>

<p>Once more, he looked down, and his eye caught<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span> sight of the papers
projecting from the inner pocket of the coat, which was still open and
thrown back upon the floor. It has been noticed more than once that
Johann Schmidt was a man subject to attacks of quite irresistible
curiosity. He hesitated a moment, and then came to the conclusion that
he was as much entitled as any one else to be the Count's executor.</p>

<p>"It cannot harm him now," he said, as he extracted the bundle from its
place.</p>

<p>One of the letters was quite fresh. The rest were evidently very old,
being yellow with age and ragged at the edges. He turned over the
former. It was addressed to Count Skariatine, at his lodging, and it
bore the postmark of a town in Great-Russia, between Petersburg and
Moscow. Schmidt took out the sheet, and his face suddenly grew very dark
and angry. The handwriting was either in reality Akulina's, or it
resembled it so closely as to have deceived a better expert than the
Cossack.</p>

<p>The missive purported to be written by the wife of Count Skariatine's
steward, and it set forth in rather servile and illiterate language that
the said Count Skariatine and his eldest son were both dead, having been
seized on the same day with the smallpox,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span> of which there had been an
epidemic in the neighbourhood, but which was supposed to have quite
disappeared when they fell ill. A week later and within twenty-four
hours of each other they had breathed their last. The Count Boris
Michaelovitch was now the heir, and would do well to come home as soon
as possible to look after his possessions, as the local authorities were
likely to make a good thing out of it in his absence.</p>

<p>The Cossack swore a terrific oath, and stamped furiously on the floor as
he rose to his feet. It was evident to him that Akulina had out of spite
concocted the letter, and had managed to have it posted by some friend
in Russia. He was not satisfied with one expletive, nor with many. The
words he used need not be translated for the reader of the English
language. It is enough to say that they were the strongest in the
Cossack vocabulary, that they were well selected and applied with force
and precision.</p>

<p>Johann Schmidt was exceedingly wroth with the tobacconist's wife, for it
was clear that she had caused the Count's untimely death by her
abominable practical joke. He went and leaned out of the window,
churning and gnashing the fantastic expressions of his rage through his
teeth.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span></p>

<p>Suddenly there was a noise in the room, a distinct, loud noise, as of
shuffling with hands and feet. The Cossack's nerves were proof against
ghostly terrors, but as he turned round he felt that his hair was
standing erect upon his head.</p>

<p>The Count was on his feet and was looking at him.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>
</div>

<p>"I thought you were dead!" gasped the Cossack in dismay.</p>

<p>There was no answer. The Count did not appear to hear Schmidt's voice
nor to see his figure. He acted like a man walking in his sleep, and it
was by no means certain to the friend who watched him that his eyes were
always open. As though nothing unusual had happened, the Count calmly
undressed himself and got into bed. Three minutes later he was sound
asleep and breathing regularly.</p>

<p>For a long time Johann Schmidt stood transfixed with wonder in his place
at the open window. At last it dawned upon him that his friend had not
been really dead, but had fallen into some sort of fit in the course of
his lonely meditations, from which he had been awakened by the Cossack's
terrific swearing. Why the latter had seemed to be invisible and
inaudible to him, was a matter which Schmidt did not attempt to solve.
It was clear that the Count was alive, and sleeping like other people.
Schmidt hesitated some time as to what he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span> should do. It was possible
that his friend might wake again, and find himself desperately ill. He
had been so evidently unlike himself, that Schmidt had feared he would
become a raving maniac in the night, and had entered the house at his
heels, seating himself upon the stairs just outside the door to wait for
events, with the odd fidelity and forethought characteristic of him. The
Count's cry had warned him that all was not right and he had entered the
room, as has been seen.</p>

<p>He determined to wait some time longer, to see whether anything would
happen. Meanwhile, he thrust Akulina's letter into his pocket,
reflecting that as it was a forgery it would be best that the Count
should not have it, lest he should be again misled by the contents. He
sat down and waited.</p>

<p>Nothing happened. The clocks chimed the quarters up to one in the
morning, a quarter-past, half-past&mdash;Schmidt was growing sleepy. The
Count breathed regularly and lay in his bed without moving. Then, at
last, the Cossack rose, looked at his friend once more, blew out the
lamp, felt his way to the door and left the room. As he walked home
through the quiet streets he swore that he would take vengeance upon
Akulina, by producing the letter and reading it in her husband's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
presence, and before the assembled establishment, before the Count made
his appearance. It was indeed not probable that he would come at all,
considering all that he had suffered, though Schmidt knew that he
generally came on Thursday morning, evidently weary and exhausted, but
unconscious of the delusion which had possessed him during the previous
day. Possibly, he was subject to a similar fit every Wednesday night,
and had kept the fact a secret. Schmidt had always wondered what
happened to him at the moment when he suddenly forgot his imaginary
fortune and returned to his everyday senses.</p>

<p>The morning dawned at last, and it was Thursday. As there was no
necessity for liberating the Count from arrest to-day, Akulina roused
her husband with the lark, gave him his coffee promptly and sent him off
to open the shop and catch the early customer. Before the shutters had
been up more than a quarter of an hour, and while Fischelowitz was still
sniffing the fresh morning air, Johann Schmidt appeared. His step was
brisk, his brow was dark and his boots creaked ominously. With a very
brief salutation he passed into the back shop, slipped off his coat and
set to work with the determination of a man who feels that he must do<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
something active as a momentary relief to his feelings.</p>

<p>Next came Vjera, paler than ever, with great black rings under her tired
eyes, broken with the fatigues and anxieties of the previous day, but
determined to double her work, if that were possible, in order to make
up for the money she had borrowed of Schmidt and, through him, of
Dumnoff. As she dropped her shawl, Fischelowitz caught sight of the back
of her head, and broke into a laugh.</p>

<p>"Why, Vjera!" he cried. "What have you done? You have made yourself look
perfectly ridiculous!"</p>

<p>The poor girl turned scarlet, and busied herself at her table without
answering. Her fingers trembled as she tried to handle her glass tube.
The Cossack, whose anger had not been diluted by being left to boil all
night, dropped his swivel knife and went up to Fischelowitz with a look
in his face so extremely disagreeable that the tobacconist drew back a
little, not knowing what to expect.</p>

<p>"I will tell you something," said Schmidt, savagely. "You will have to
change your manners if you expect any of us to work for you."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" stammered Fischelowitz, in whom nature had omitted
to implant the gift of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span> physical courage, except in such measure as
saved him from the humiliation of being afraid of his wife.</p>

<p>"I mean what I say," answered the Cossack. "And if there is anything I
hate, it is to repeat what I have said before hitting a man." His fists
were clenched already, and one of them looked as though it were on the
point of making a very emphatic gesture. Fischelowitz retired backwards
into the front shop, while Vjera looked on from within, now pale again
and badly frightened.</p>

<p>"Herr Schmidt! Herr Schmidt! Please, please be quiet! It does not
matter!" she cried.</p>

<p>"Then what does matter?" inquired the Cossack over his shoulders, "If
Vjera has cut off her hair," he said, turning again to Fischelowitz,
"she has had a good reason for it. It is none of your business, nor mine
either."</p>

<p>So saying he was about to go back to his work again.</p>

<p>"Upon my word!" exclaimed the tobacconist. "Upon my word! I do not
understand what has got into the fellow."</p>

<p>"You do not understand?" cried Schmidt, facing him again. "I mean that
if you laugh at Vjera I will break most of your bones."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span></p>

<p>At that moment Akulina's stout figure appeared, entering from the
street. The Cossack stood still, glaring at her, his face growing white
and contracted with anger. He was becoming dangerous, as good-tempered
men will, when roused, especially when they have been brought up among
people who, as a tribe, would rather fight than eat, at any time of day,
from pure love of the thing. Even Akulina, who was not timid, hesitated
as she stood on the threshold.</p>

<p>"What has happened?" she inquired, looking from Schmidt to her husband.</p>

<p>The latter came to her side, if not for protection, as might be
maliciously supposed, at least for company.</p>

<p>"I cannot understand at all," said Fischelowitz, still edging away.</p>

<p>"You understand well enough, I think, and as for you, Frau Fischelowitz,
I have something to talk of with you, too. But we will put it off until
later," he added, as though suddenly changing his mind.</p>

<p>The Count himself had appeared in the doorway behind Akulina. Both she
and her husband stood aside, looking at him curiously.</p>

<p>"Good-morning," he said, gravely taking off his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span> hat and inclining his
head a little. He acted as though quite unconscious of what had happened
on the previous day, and they watched him as he quietly went into the
room beyond, into which the Cossack had retired on seeing him enter.</p>

<p>He hung up his hat in its usual place, nodding to Schmidt, who was
opposite to him. Then, as he turned, he met Vjera's eyes. It was a
supreme moment for her, poor child. Would he remember anything of what
had passed on the previous day? Or had he forgotten all, his debt, her
saving of him and the sacrifice she had made? He looked at her so long
and so steadily that she grew frightened. Then all at once he came close
to her, and took her hand and kissed it as he had done when they had
last parted, careless of Schmidt's presence.</p>

<p>"I have not forgotten, dear Vjera," he whispered in her ear.</p>

<p>Schmidt passed them quickly and again went out, whether from a sense of
delicacy, or because he saw an opportunity of renewing the fight
outside, is not certain. He closed the door of communication behind him.</p>

<p>Vjera looked up into the Count's eyes and the blush that rarely came,
the blush of true happiness, mounted to her face.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have not forgotten, dearest," he said again. "There is a veil over
yesterday&mdash;I think I must have been ill&mdash;but I know what you did for me
and&mdash;and&mdash;" he hesitated as though seeking an expression.</p>

<p>For a few seconds again the poor girl felt the agony of suspense she
knew so well.</p>

<p>"I do not know what right a man so poor as I has to say such a thing,
Vjera," he continued. "But I love you, dear, and if you will take me, I
will love you all my life, more and more. Will it be harder to be poor
together than each for ourselves, alone?"</p>

<p>Vjera let her head fall upon his shoulder, happy at last. What did his
madness matter now, since the one memory she craved had survived its
destroying influence? He had forgotten his glorious hopes, his imaginary
wealth, his expected friends, but he had not forgotten her, nor his love
for her.</p>

<p>"Thank God!" she sighed, and the happy tears fell from her eyes upon the
breast of his threadbare coat.</p>

<p>"But we must not forget to work, dear," she said, a few moments later.</p>

<p>"No," he answered. "We must not forget to work."</p>

<p>As she sat down to her table he pushed her chair back for her, and put
into her hands her little glass<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span> tube, and then he went and took his own
place opposite. For a long time they were left alone, but neither of
them seemed to wonder at it, nor to hear the low, excited tones of many
voices talking rapidly and often together in the shop outside. Whenever
their eyes met, they both smiled, while their fingers did the accustomed
mechanical work.</p>

<p>When Schmidt entered the outer shop for the second time, he found the
tobacconist and his wife conversing in low tones together, in evident
fear of being overheard. He came and stood before them, lowering his
voice to the pitch of theirs, as he spoke.</p>

<p>"It is no fault of yours that the Count was not found dead in his bed
this morning," he began, fixing his fiery eyes on Akulina.</p>

<p>"What? What? What is this?" asked Fischelowitz excitedly.</p>

<p>"Only this," said the Cossack, displaying the letter he had brought from
the Count's rooms. "Nothing more. Your wife has succeeded very well. He
is quite mad now. I found him last night, helpless, in a sort of fit,
stiff and stark on the floor of his room. And this was in his pocket.
Read it, Herr Fischelowitz. Read it, by all means. I suppose your wife
does not mind your reading the letters she writes."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span></p>

<p>Fischelowitz took the letter stupidly, turned it over, saw the address,
and took out the folded sheet. Akulina's face expressed a blank
amazement almost comical in its vacuity. For once, she was taken off her
guard. Her husband read the letter over twice and examined the
handwriting curiously.</p>

<p>"A joke is a joke, Akulina," he said at last. "But you have carried this
too far. What if the Count had died?"</p>

<p>"I would like to know what I am accused of," said Akulina, "and what all
this is about."</p>

<p>"I suppose you know your own handwriting," observed the Cossack, taking
the letter from the tobacconist's hands and holding it before her eyes.
"And if that is not enough to drive the poor man to the madhouse I do
not know what is. Perhaps you have forgotten all about it? Perhaps you
are mad, too?"</p>

<p>Akulina read the writing in her turn. Then she grew very angry.</p>

<p>"It is an abominable lie!" she exclaimed. "I never had anything to do
with it. I do not know whence this letter comes, and I do not care. I
know nothing about it."</p>

<p>"I suppose no one can prevent your saying so, at least," retorted the
Cossack.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is very queer," observed Fischelowitz, suddenly thrusting his hands
into his pockets and beginning to whistle softly as he looked through
the shop window.</p>

<p>"When I tell you that it is not my handwriting, you ought to be
satisfied&mdash;" Akulina began.</p>

<p>"And yet none of us are," interrupted the Cossack with a laugh.
"Strange, is it not?"</p>

<p>Dumnoff now came in, and a moment later the insignificant girl, who
began to giggle foolishly as soon as she saw that something was
happening which she could not understand.</p>

<p>"None of us are satisfied," continued Johann Schmidt, taking the letter
from Akulina. "Here, Dumnoff, here Anna Nicolaevna, is this the
Chosjaika's handwriting or not? Let everybody see and judge."</p>

<p>"It is outrageous!" exclaimed Akulina, trying to get possession of the
letter again.</p>

<p>"You see how she tries to get it," laughed the Cossack, savagely. "She
would be glad to tear it to pieces&mdash;of course she would."</p>

<p>"I wish you would all go about your business," said Fischelowitz with an
approach to asperity.</p>

<p>Akulina was furious, but she did not know what to do. Everybody began
talking together.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span></p>

<p>"Of course it is the Barina's handwriting," said Dumnoff confidently. He
supposed it was always safe to follow Schmidt's lead, when he followed
any one.</p>

<p>"Of course it is," chimed in the insignificant Anna.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you minx&mdash;you flatter-cat, you little serpent!" cried Akulina,
speaking three languages at once in her excitement. "Go&mdash;get along&mdash;go
to your work&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no, stay!" exclaimed the Cossack authoritatively. "Do you know what
this is?" he asked of all present again. "Our good mistress, here, has
for some reason or other been trying to make the Count worse by having
sham letters posted to him from home&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is a lie! A base, abominable lie! Turn the man out, Christian
Gregorovitch! Turn him out, or send for the police."</p>

<p>"Turn him out yourself," answered the tobacconist phlegmatically.</p>

<p>"Posted to him from home," continued the Cossack, "and telling him that
his father and brother are dead and that he has come into property and
the like. What do you think of that?"</p>

<p>"It is a shame," growled Dumnoff, beginning to understand.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span></p>

<p>The girl laughed foolishly.</p>

<p>"I swear to you," began Akulina, crimson with anger. "I swear to you by
all&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Customers, customers!" exclaimed Fischelowitz in a stage whisper.
"Quiet, I tell you!" He made a rush for the other side of the counter,
and briskly assumed his professional smile. The others fell back into
the corners.</p>

<p>Two gentlemen in black entered the shop. The one was a stout,
angry-looking person of middle age, very dark, and very full about the
lower part of the face, which was not concealed by the closely cut black
beard. His companion was a diminutive little man, very thin and very
spruce, not less than fifty years old. His face was entirely shaved and
was deeply marked with lines and furrows. A pair of piercing grey eyes
looked through big gold-rimmed spectacles. As he took off his hat, a few
thin, sandy-coloured locks fluttered a little and then settled
themselves upon the smooth surface of his cranium, like autumn leaves
falling upon a marble statue in a garden.</p>

<p>"Herr Fischelowitz?" inquired the larger of the two customers, touching
his hat but not removing it.</p>

<p>"At your service," answered the tobacconist.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span> "Cigarettes?" he inquired.
"Strong? Light? Kir, Samson, Dubec?"</p>

<p>"I am the new Russian Consul," said the stranger. "This gentleman is
just arrived from Petersburg and has business with you."</p>

<p>"My name is Konstantin Grabofsky, and I am a lawyer," observed the
little man very sharply.</p>

<p>Fischelowitz bowed till his nose almost came into collision with the
counter. The others in the shop held their peace and opened their eyes.</p>

<p>"And I am told that Count Boris Michaelovitch Skariatine is here,"
continued the lawyer.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;the mad Count!" exclaimed Akulina with an angry laugh, and coming
forward. "Yes, we can tell you all about him."</p>

<p>"I am sorry," said Grabofsky, "to hear you call him mad, since my
business is with him, Barina, and not with you." His tone was, if
possible, more incisive than before.</p>

<p>"Of course, we know that he is not a Count at all," said Akulina,
somewhat annoyed by his sharpness.</p>

<p>"Do you? Then you are singularly mistaken. I shall be obliged if you
will inform Count Skariatine that Konstantin Grabofsky desires the
honour of an interview with him."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span></p>

<p>"Go and call him, Akulina," said Fischelowitz, "since the gentleman
wishes to see him."</p>

<p>"Go yourself," retorted his wife.</p>

<p>"Go together, and be quick about it!" said the Consul, who was tired of
waiting.</p>

<p>"And please to say that I wait his convenience," added the lawyer.</p>

<p>Dumnoff moved to Schmidt's side and whispered into his ear.</p>

<p>"Do you think they have come about the Gigerl?" he inquired anxiously.
"Do you think they will arrest us again?"</p>

<p>"Durak!" laughed the Cossack. "How can two Russian gentlemen arrest you
in Munich? This is something connected with the Count's friends. It is
my belief that they have come at last. See&mdash;here he is."</p>

<p>The Count now entered from the back shop, calm and collected, as though
not expecting anything extraordinary. The Russian Consul took off his
hat and bowed with great politeness and the Count returned the
salutation with equal civility. Fischelowitz and Akulina stood in the
background anxiously watching events.</p>

<p>The lawyer also bowed and then, turning his face to the light, held his
hand out.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span></p>

<p>"You have not forgotten me, Count Skariatine?" he said, in a tone of
inquiry.</p>

<p>The Count stared hard at him as he took the proffered hand. Gradually,
his face underwent a change. His forehead contracted, his eyes closed a
little, his eyebrows rose, and an expression of quiet disdain settled
about the lines of his mouth.</p>

<p>"I know you very well," he answered. "You are Doctor Konstantin
Grabofsky, my father's lawyer. Do you come from him to renew the offer
you made when we parted?"</p>

<p>"I have no offer to make," said the little man. "Will you do me the
honour to indicate some place where we may be alone together for a
moment?"</p>

<p>"I have no objection to that," replied the Count. "We can go into the
street."</p>

<p>They passed out together, leaving the establishment of Christian
Fischelowitz in a condition of great astonishment. The tobacconist
hastily produced his best cigarettes and entreated the Consul to try
one, making signs to the other occupants of the shop to return to their
occupations in the inner room.</p>

<p>"How long have you known Count Skariatine?" inquired the Consul,
carelessly, when he was alone with Fischelowitz.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span></p>

<p>"Six or seven years," answered the latter.</p>

<p>"I suppose you know his story? Your wife was good enough to inform us of
that fact, though Doctor Grabofsky has reason to doubt the value of her
information."</p>

<p>"We only know that he calls himself a Count." Fischelowitz held the
authorities of his native country in holy awe, and was almost frightened
out of his senses at being thus questioned by the Consul.</p>

<p>"He is quite at liberty to do so," answered the latter with a laugh.
"The story is simple enough," he continued, "and there is no reason why
you should not know it. The late Count Skariatine had two sons, of whom
the present Count was the younger. Ten years ago, when barely twenty, he
quarrelled with his father and elder brother, and they parted in anger.
I must say that he seems to have acted hastily, though the old
gentleman's views of life were eccentric, to say the least of it. For
some reason or other, the elder brother never married. I have heard it
said that he was crippled in childhood. Be that as it may, he was
vindictive and spiteful by nature, and prevented the quarrel from being
forgotten. The younger brother left the house with the clothes on his
back, and steadily refused to accept the small allowance offered him,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
and which was his by right. And now the father and the eldest son are
dead&mdash;they died suddenly of the smallpox&mdash;and Doctor Grabofsky has come
to inform the Count that he is the heir. There you have the story in a
nutshell."</p>

<p>"Then it is all true, after all!" cried Fischelowitz. "We all thought&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Thinking, when one knows nothing, is a dangerous and useless pastime,"
observed the Consul. "I will take a box of these cigarettes with me.
They are good."</p>

<p>"Thank you most obediently, Milostivy Gosudar!" exclaimed Fischelowitz,
bowing low. "I trust that the Gospodin Consul will honour me with his
patronage. I have a great variety of tobaccos, Kir, Basma, Samson, Dubec
Imperial, Swary&mdash;"</p>

<p>While Fischelowitz was recommending the productions of his Celebrated
Manufactory to the Consul, Grabofsky and the Count were walking together
up and down the smooth pavement outside.</p>

<p>"A great change has taken place in your family," Grabofsky was saying.
"Had anything less extraordinary occurred, I should have written to you
instead of coming in person. Your brother is dead, Count Skariatine."</p>

<p>"Dead!" exclaimed the Count, who had no recollection<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span> of the letter
abstracted from his pocket by the Cossack. It had reached him after the
weekly attack had begun, and the memory of it was gone with that of so
many other occurrences.</p>

<p>"Dead," repeated the lawyer sharply, as though he would have made a nail
of the word to drive it into the coffin.</p>

<p>"And how many children has he left?" inquired the Count.</p>

<p>"He died unmarried."</p>

<p>"So that I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You are the lawful heir."</p>

<p>"Unless my father marries again." The colour rose in the Count's lean
cheeks.</p>

<p>"That is impossible."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because he is dead, too."</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You are Count Skariatine, and I have the honour to offer you my
services at this important juncture."</p>

<p>The Count breathed hard. The shock, overtaking him when he was in his
normal condition, was tremendous. The colour came and went rapidly in
his features, and he caught his breath, leaning heavily upon the little
lawyer, who watched his face with some anxiety. Akulina's remark about
the Count's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span> madness had made him more careful than he would otherwise
have been in his manner of breaking the news.</p>

<p>"I am not well," said the Count in a low voice. "To-day is Wednesday&mdash;I
am never well on Wednesdays."</p>

<p>"To-day is Thursday," answered Grabofsky.</p>

<p>"Thursday? Thursday&mdash;" the Count reeled, and would have fallen, but for
the support of the nervous little man's wiry arm.</p>

<p>Then, in the space of a second, took place that strange phenomenon of
the intelligence which is as yet so imperfectly understood. It is called
the "Transfer" in the jargon of the half-developed science which deals
with suggestion and the like. Its effects are strange, sudden and
complete, often observed, never understood, but chronicled in hundreds
of cases and analysed in every seat of physiological learning in Europe.
In the twinkling of an eye, a part or the whole of the intelligence, or
of the sensations, is reversed in action, and this with a logical
precision of which no description can give any idea. It is universally
considered as the first step in the direction of recovery.</p>

<p>The action of the Count's mind was "transferred," therefore, since the
word is consecrated by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span> usage. Fortunately for him, the transfer
coincided with a material change in his fortunes. Had this not been the
case it would have had the effect of making him mad through the whole
week, and sane only from Tuesday evening until the midnight of
Wednesday. As it was, the result was of a contrary nature. Being now in
reality restored to wealth and dignity, he was able to understand and
appreciate the reality during six days, becoming again, in imagination,
a cigarette-maker upon the seventh, a harmless delusion which already
shows signs of disappearing, and from which the principal authorities
confidently assert that he will soon be quite free.</p>

<p>He passed but one moment in a state of semi-consciousness. Then he
raised his head, and stood erect, and to the great surprise of
Grabofsky, showed no further surprise at the news he had just received.</p>

<p>"The fact is," he said, quietly, "I was expecting you yesterday. I had
received a letter from the wife of the steward informing me of the death
of my father and brother. I think your coming to-day must have disturbed
me, as I have some difficulty in recalling the circumstances which
attended our meeting here."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span></p>

<p>"A passing indisposition," suggested Grabofsky. "Nothing more. The
weather is warm, sultry in fact."</p>

<p>"Yes, it must have been that. And now, we had better communicate the
state of things to Herr Fischelowitz, to whom I consider myself much
indebted."</p>

<p>"Our Consul came with me," said the lawyer. "He is in the shop. Perhaps
you did not notice him."</p>

<p>"No&mdash;I do not think I did. I am afraid he thought me very careless."</p>

<p>"Not at all, not at all." Grabofsky began to think that there had been
some truth in Akulina's remarks after all, but he kept his opinion to
himself, then and afterwards, a course which was justified by subsequent
events. He and the Count turned towards the shop, and, entering, found
Fischelowitz and the Consul conversing together.</p>

<p>The Count bowed to the latter with much ceremony.</p>

<p>"I fear," he said, "that you must have thought me careless just now. The
suddenness of the news I have received has affected me. Pray accept my
best thanks for your kindness in accompanying Doctor Grabofsky this
morning."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do not mention it, Count. I am only too glad to be of service."</p>

<p>"You are very kind. And now, Herr Fischelowitz," he continued, turning
to the tobacconist, "it is my pleasant duty to thank you also. I looked
for these gentlemen yesterday. They have arrived to-day. The change
which I expected would take place has come, and I am about to return to
my home. The memories of poverty and exile can never be pleasant, but I
do not think that I have any just reason to complain. Will it please
you, Herr Fischelowitz, and you, gentlemen, to go into the next room
with me? I wish to take my leave of those who have so long been my
companions."</p>

<p>Fischelowitz opened the door of communication and held it back
respectfully for the Count to pass. His ideas were exceedingly confused,
but his instinct told him to make all atonement in his power for his
wife's outbursts of temper. The Count entered first, and the other three
followed him, Grabofsky, the Consul, and Fischelowitz. The little back
shop was very full. To judge from the last accents of Akulina's voice
she had been repaying Johann Schmidt with compound interest, now that
the right was on her side, for the manner in which he had attacked her.
As the Count entered, however,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span> all held their peace, and he began to
speak in the midst of total silence. He stood by the little black table
upon which his lean, stained fingers had manufactured so many hundreds
of thousands of cigarettes.</p>

<p>"Herr Fischelowitz," he began, "I am here to say good-bye to you, to
your good wife, and to my companions. During a number of years you have
afforded me the opportunity of earning an honest living, and I have to
thank you very heartily for the forbearance you have shown me. It is not
your fault if your consideration for me has sometimes taken a passive
rather than an active form. It was not your business to fight my
battles. Give me your hand, Herr Fischelowitz. We part, as we have
lived, good friends. I wish you all possible success."</p>

<p>The tobacconist bowed low as he respectfully shook hands.</p>

<p>"Too much honour," he said.</p>

<p>"Frau Fischelowitz," continued the Count, "you have acted according to
your lights and your beliefs. I bear you no ill-will. I only hope that
if any other poor gentleman should ever take my place you will not make
his position harder than it would naturally be, and I trust that all may
be well with you."</p>

<p>"I never meant it, Herr Graf," said Akulina, awkwardly, as she took his
proffered hand.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span></p>

<p>He turned to the Cossack.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, Johann Schmidt, good-bye. I shall see you again, before long.
We have always helped each other, my friend. I have much to thank you
for."</p>

<p>"You have helped me, you mean," said the Cossack, in a rather shaky
voice.</p>

<p>"No, no&mdash;each other, and we will continue to do so, I hope, in a
different way. Good-bye, Dumnoff. You have a better heart than people
think."</p>

<p>"Are you not going to take me to Russia, after all?" asked the mujik,
almost humbly.</p>

<p>"Did I say I would? Then you shall go. But not as coachman, Dumnoff. Not
as coachman, I think. Good-bye, Anna Nicolaevna," he said, turning to
the insignificant girl, who was at last too much awed to giggle.</p>

<p>Then he came to Vjera's place. The girl was leaning forward, hiding her
face in her hands, and resting her small, pointed elbows on the table.</p>

<p>"Vjera, dear," he said, bending down to her, "will you come with me,
now?"</p>

<p>She looked up, suddenly, and her face was very white and drawn, and wet
with tears.</p>

<p>"Oh no, no!" she said in a low voice. "How can I ever be worthy of you,
since it is really true?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span></p>

<p>But the Count put his arm round the poor little shell-maker's waist, and
made her stand beside him in the midst of them all.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," he said, in his calmly dignified manner, "let me present to
you the Countess Skariatine. She will bear that name to-morrow. I owe
you a confession before leaving you, in her honour and to my
humiliation. I had contracted a debt of honour, and I had nothing
wherewith to pay it. There was but an hour left&mdash;an hour, and then my
life and my honour would have been gone together."</p>

<p>Vjera looked up into his face with a pitiful entreaty, but he would go
on.</p>

<p>"She saved me, gentlemen," he continued. "She cut off her beautiful hair
from her head, and sold it for me. But that is not the reason why she is
to be my wife. There is a better reason than that. I love her,
gentlemen, with all my heart and soul, and she has told me that she
loves me."</p>

<p>He felt her weight upon him, and, looking down, he saw that she had
fainted in his arms, with a look of joy upon her poor wan face which
none there had ever seen in the face of man or woman.</p>

<p>And so love conquered.</p>

Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
